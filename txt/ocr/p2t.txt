Edition
The Eternal Now
Lewis H . Lapham

T h i r t y years ago this past summer Herbert
Marshall M c L u h a n published Understanding
Media: The Extensions of Man, and w i t h i n a
matter of months the book acquired the
standing of H o l y Scripture and made of its
author the foremost oracle of the age. Seld o m i n living memory had so obscure a
scholar descended so abruptly f r o m so remote a garret into the center ring of the
celebrity circus, but M c L u h a n accepted the
transformation as i f it were nothing out of
the ordinary, nothing more than the inevitable and unsurprising proof of the hypothesis that he had found in the library at the
University of T o r o n t o . H e was
fifty-two
years old at the time, Canadian by birth
and a professor of English literature. As
enigmatic as he was self-preoccupied, he
had about h i m the air of a man who believed
that it was the business of prophets to bring
prophetic news, and i f he had peered into
the mist of the future and foreseen the

xl Understanding Media
passing of the printed w o r d , w e l l , he had done no more than notice
what was both obvious and certain.
H i s book introduced into the language our present usage of the
term media, as well as a number of other precepts, among them
"global village" and "Age of I n f o r m a t i o n " that since have become
commonplaces, and by the fall of 1965 Understanding Media had
prompted the New York Herald Tribune, speaking on behalf of what
was then the consensus of informed opinion to proclaim its author
"the most important thinker since N e w t o n , D a r w i n , Freud, E i n stein and Pavlov. . . . " For the next four or five years M c L u h a n
toured the television talk shows as well as the corporate lecture
circuit, astonishing his audiences w i t h a persona that joined, in T o m
Wolfe's phrase, "the charisma o f a haruspex w i t h the irresistible
certitude of the monomaniac." Woody Allen placed h i m on the set
of Annie Hall, and artists as well k n o w n as A n d y Warhol and Robert
Rauschenberg appointed h i m to the office of honorary muse. I n
journals as unlike one another as Newsweek and Partisan Review, the
resident cognoscenti found that when confronted w i t h sets of o t h erwise unrelated circumstance they could resolve their confusion
merely by deploying the adjective "McLuhanesque." A l t h o u g h
transformed into an eponym, the sage of the north retained the
character of the rumpled professor, a gaunt and kindly figure, disorganized, absent-minded and quixotically dressed, always sure that
the whole w o r l d could be made to fit into the trunk of his hypothesis, bestowing on audiences young and o l d , whether of insurance
executives or guitarists on their way to Woodstock, the gifts of
Delphic aphorism:
" T h e electric light is pure i n f o r m a t i o n . "
"We are moving out of the age of the visual into the age of the
aural and tactile."
"We are the television screen. . . . We wear all mankind as our
skin."
But even as M c L u h a n passed across the zenith of his fame, few
of the people w h o explicated his text fully understood what it was
that he was t r y i n g to say. T h e y guessed that he had come upon
something important, but for the most part they interpreted h i m as
a dealer in communications theory and turned his prophecies to

Introduction to the MIT Press Edition I x\
practical uses of their o w n . M c L u h a n had classified print as a hot
medium and television as a cool medium, and although not one
critic in five hundred was entirely sure what he meant by the
distinction, the phrases served to justify a $40 million advertising
campaign, a novel lacking both a protagonist and a plot, a collage
of junked automobile tires.
T h e alarms and excursions associated w i t h Understanding Media
didn't survive McLuhan's death (on N e w Year's Eve 1980, at the
age of sixty-nine), and as perhaps was to be expected f r o m artisans
still working in a medium that the decedent had pronounced obsolete, the obituary notices were less than worshipful. Informed
opinion had moved on to other things, and McLuhan's name and
reputation were sent to the attic w i t h the rest of the sensibility (gogo boots, Sgt. Pepper, Woodstock, the Vietnam War) that embodied
the failed hopes of a discredited decade.
T h e judgment was poorly timed. M u c h of what M c L u h a n had
to say makes a good deal more sense i n 1994 than it d i d in 1964,
and even as his book was being remanded to the backlist, its more
profound implications were beginning to make themselves manifest
on M T V and the Internet, i n Ronald Reagan's political image and
the re-animation of Richard N i x o n , via television shopping networks
and e-mail—all of them technologies that M c L u h a n had presupposed but didn't live to see shaped i n silicon or glass.
Despite its title, the book was never easy to understand. By turns
brilliant and opaque, McLuhan's thought meets the specifications
of the epistemology that he ascribes to the electronic media—nonlineal, repetitive, discontinuous, intuitive, proceeding by analogy
instead of sequential argument. Beginning f r o m the premise that
"we become what we behold," that "we shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us," M c L u h a n examines the diktats of t w o
technological revolutions that overthrew a settled political and aesthetic order: first, i n the mid-fifteenth century, the invention of
printing w i t h movable type, w h i c h encouraged people to think i n
straight lines and to arrange their perceptions of the world i n forms
convenient to the visual order of the printed page; second, since the
late nineteenth century, the new applications of electricity (telegraph, telephone, television, computers, etc.), w h i c h taught people

xiilUnderstanding

Media

to rearrange their perceptions o f the w o r l d i n ways convenient to
the protocols of cyberspace. Content follows f o r m , and the insurgent technologies give rise to new structures of feeling and thought.
Once having stated this proposition, M c L u h a n works i t through
a series of variations for the entire orchestra of human expression,
and his chapter titles {The Gadget Lover: Narcissus as Narcosis; The
Typewriter: Into the Age of the Iron W h i m ; Weapons: War of the
Icons; The Photograph: T h e Brothel w i t h o u t Walls) bear witness both
to the tone of his rhetoric and the reach of his ambition. H i s
vocabulary takes some getting used to (writing is visual; television
is aural and tactile), and quite a few of the notions to w h i c h he offhandedly refers i n the early pages, as i f everybody already knew
what he meant, he doesn't bother to explain until the later pages,
often by way o f an afterthought or an aside. N o t until page 305
does he suggest that the content o f any medium is always another
medium—"the content of the press is literary statement, as the
content of the book is speech, and the content of the movie is the
novel"—and it is only on page 349 that he clarifies his use of the
phrase "mass media" by saying that "they are an indication, not of
the size of their audiences, but of the fact that everybody becomes
involved i n them at the same t i m e . "
Some of his variations seem more credible than others, but I find
that by making a list of the leitmotifs that wander i n and out of his
prose i n the manner of Homeric epithets, I can formulate his d i alectic as a set of antonyms. T h e meanings i n the left-hand column
M c L u h a n aligns w i t h the ascendancy of the printed w o r d during
the four centuries between Johann Gutenberg's invention of printing
w i t h movable type and Thomas Edison's invention of the electric
light; the meanings in the right hand column he associates w i t h the
sensibility now k n o w n as postmodern.

W i t h i n a week o f the publication of Understanding Media, the
guardians of the established literary order i n Toronto and N e w
York read i n the right-hand column the portents of their o w n doom,
and they were quick to find fault w i t h what the more scornful
among them called McLuhan's "incantation." Speaking mostly to
themselves, they dismissed w i t h contempt McLuhan's weird and
h y b r i d dabbling i n "scientific mysticism," his superficial understanding of modern art, his naive faith i n technology, and his too
primitive belief i n "merely physical sensation." A number of the
objections were well taken, most especially the ones pertaining to
McLuhan's discussion of the central nervous system (a subject i n
clinical neurology about which he knew almost nothing), but for
the most part the dyspeptic critics contrived to miss the point,
refusing to accept McLuhan's approach to his topic and reducing
the sum of his hypothesis to the trivial observation that the " E d
Sullivan Show" was easier to read than the collected works of
Wittgenstein and Plotinus. H e was talking about the media as
"make-happen agents," not as "make-aware agents," as systems similar to roads and canals, not as precious art objects or uplifting
models of behavior, and he repeatedly reminds his readers that his
proposition is best understood as a literary trope, not as a scientific
theory. H i s method is that of an English professor long acquainted
w i t h libraries and familiar w i t h the apparatus of academic scholarship. Delighting i n bookish puns, he constantly cites as his authorities the idols of the Age of Print and quotes at length f r o m the
novels of James Joyce, chiefly Finnegans Wake, and the poems of
T . S. Eliot and W i l l i a m Blake, the letters of John Ruskin.

xiv/ Understanding Media
As often as not he employs the quotations to make sport of the
high-minded literary gentlemen w h o continue to believe that all
would be well i f only the television networks would improve and
correct the vulgar tone of their programming schedules, and he likes
to compare his critics to the schoolmen of the late sixteenth century
who railed against Gutenberg's typefaces as the precursors of intellectual anarchy and "the end of civilization as we know i t " — t h a t is,
of an oral tradition founded upon illuminated manuscripts preserved
in the vaults of a few monasteries. Just as the advent of print placed
the means of communication i n the hands of a good many people
previously presumed silent (prompting an excited rush of words
f r o m , among others, Rabelais, Cervantes, and Shakespeare) so also
the broad dissemination of the electronic media invites correspondence f r o m a good many more people presumed illiterate, and
M c L u h a n suggests that i n the twentieth century as in the sixteenth,
the literary man prefers "to view w i t h alarm to point w i t h pride,
while scrupulously ignoring what's going o n . " H e has little sympathy or patience for people w h o defend positions already lost, and
against the more pompous members of the literary academy (those
who would restore the Republic of Letters as i f it were a Colonial
Williamsburg) he brings to bear a sardonic sense of h u m o r — " f o r
many years I've observed that the moralist typically substitutes
anger for perception."
His irony speaks to the superfluousness of most o f the criticism
directed against the electronic media over the last t h i r t y years, and
while reading his book I was reminded of some of m y o w n irrelevent
pronouncements about the banality of network soap opera or the
idiocy of the evening news. I had thought the pronouncements
astute, or at least plausible, until I had occasion to write a six-hour
television history of the twentieth century and discovered in the
process what M c L u h a n meant by the phrase, "the medium is the
message." A l l o w e d 78 seconds and 43 words i n w h i c h to explain
the origins of W o r l d War I I and provide the transition between the
M u n i c h Conference i n September 1938 and Germany's invasion of
Poland in September 1939, I understood that television is not narrative, that it bears more of a resemblance to symbolist poetry or
the pointillist painting of Georges Seurat than it does to anything

Introduction to the MIT Press Edition I xv
conceived by a novelist, a historian, an essayist, or even a writer of
newspaper editorials.
Understanding Media confirms m y o w n experience on both sides
of a television camera, and I think of i t as the kind of book that the
reader can open almost at random, taking from it what he or she
has the w i t to find. Some of McLuhan's observations lead nowhere;
others deserve at least fifty pages of further commentary, and I ' m
surprised that over the last t h i r t y years, despite the constant and
obsessive muttering about the media—their ubiquitous presence and
innate wickedness—so few critics have taken account of McLuhan's
general theory. H i s prescience is extraordinary, and the events of
the last t h i r t y years have proved h i m more often right than wrong.
H i s hypothesis anticipates by t w o decades the dissolution of international frontiers and the collapse of the Cold War. H e assumes the
inevitable rearrangement of university curricula under the rubrics
of what we now call " m u l t i c u l t u r a l i s m , " and he knows that as
commodities come to possess "more and more the character of
information," the amassment of wealth w i l l come to depend upon
the naming of the things rather than the making of things. Recognizing the weightlessness and self-referential character of the electronic media as well as the supremacy of the corporate logo or the
Q rating, M c L u h a n describes a w o r l d i n w h i c h people live most of
their lives w i t h i n the enclosed and mediated spaces governed by the
rule of images. As is his custom, he best expresses the general point
in a conversational aside, while he seems to be talking about something else:
Travel differs very little from going to a movie or turning the
pages of a magazine. . . . People . . . never arrive at any new
place. T h e y can have Shanghai or Berlin or Venice in a package
tour that they need never open. . . . T h u s the world itself becomes
a sort of museum of objects that have been encountered before in
some other medium. (198)

Let technology be understood, i n Max Frisch's phrase, as "the
knack of so arranging the w o r l d so that we don't have to experience
i t , " and McLuhan's point about the museum explains not only Ralph
Lauren's fortune and B i l l Clinton's presence in the White House,
but also the state of disrepair into w h i c h the United States has let

xviy'Understanding Media
fall its highways, its railroads, and its cities. I f the media are nothing
more than the means of storing and transporting information, and
if by assuming the character of information commodities can be
moved by fiber optics, fax machines, and A T M cards, then w h y
bother to maintain an infrastructure geared to the purposes of medieval Europe or ancient Rome?
O n almost every page of Understanding Media M c L u h a n sets i n
motion equally promising lines of speculation, and although I ' m
tempted to pursue at least five or six of t h e m — i n particular the one
ascribing the existence of Nazi Germany to the match between the
medium of radio and A d o l f Hitler's political persona (a persona that
would have failed utterly on television)—I only have space enough
to take up his point about the media's preoccupation w i t h what our
more eminent critics still insist on deploring as "the bad news."
Nowhere else have I come across so succinct a reply to the ceaseless
lament about the viciousness of the yellow press. M c L u h a n notices,
correctly, that i t is the bad news—reports of sexual scandal, natural
disaster, and violent death—that sells the good news—that is, the
advertisements. T h e bad news is the spiel that brings the suckers
into the tent. Like the illustrations in a fifth-grade reader, the sequence of scenes on CBS or C N N teaches the late-twentieth-century American catechism: first, at the top of the news, the
admonitory row of body bags being loaded into ambulances in
Brooklyn or south M i a m i ; second, the inferno of tenement fires and
burning warehouses; t h i r d , a sullen procession of criminals arraigned for robbery or murder and led away in chains. T h e text of
the day's lesson having been thus established, the camera makes its
happy return to the always smiling anchorwoman, and s o — w i t h
her gracious permission—to the previews of heaven sponsored by
Delta Airlines, Calvin K l e i n , and the State Farm Insurance companies. T h e homily is as plain as a medieval morality play or the
bloodstains on D o n Johnson's A r m a n i suit—obey the law, pay your
taxes, speak politely to the police officer, and you go to the V i r g i n
Islands on the American Express card. Disobey the law, neglect
your insurance payments, speak rudely to the police, and you go
to Kings County Hospital in a body bag.
It is the business of the mass media to sell products—their o w n
as well as those o f their clients—and the critics who complain about

Introduction to the MIT Press Edition I x\ '\\
the ceaseless shows o f violence miss the comparison to the cocaine
trade. Bad news engages the viewer's participation i n what M c Luhan recognized as a collective surge of intense consciousness (a
"process that makes the content of the item seem quite secondary")
and sets h i m up for the good news, which is much more expensively
produced. A thirty-second television commercial sells for as much
as $500,000 and can cost over $1 million to make; i n Time magazine,
a single page of color advertising costs roughly $125,000 (a sum
equivalent to the annual salary paid to one of the magazine's better
writers), and M c L u h a n accurately accounts for the orders of priority
by saying that the historians and archeologists one day w i l l discover
that the twentieth century's commercial advertisements (like the
stained-glass windows of fourteenth century cathedrals) offer the
"richest and most faithful reflections that any society ever made of
its entire range of activities."
M c L u h a n developed his dialectic during twenty years of teaching
undergraduate courses i n what was called "pop culture" at a succession of provincial universities i n the U n i t e d States and Canada, and
as he learned better to understand the psychic effects of the electronic media, most notably their tendency to compress—and by so
doing dissolve—the dimensions of space and time, he began to posit
the existence of a w o r l d soul. I n his more transcendent and optimistic moments he gives way to a Utopian mysticism founded on
his reading of G . K . Chesterton and his conversion, i n his early
twenties, to Catholicism. Believing that i t was the grammar of print
that divided mankind into isolated factions o f selfishly defined i n terests, castes, nationalities, and provinces of feeling, M c L u h a n also
believes that the u n i f y i n g networks of electronic communication
might restore mankind to a state of bliss not unlike the one said to
have existed w i t h i n the Garden of Eden. Every now and then he
beholds a Biblical vision i n the desert:
If the work of the city is the remaking or translating of man into
a more suitable form than his nomadic ancestors achieved, then
might not our current translation of our entire lives into the
spiritual form of information seem to make of the entire globe,
and of the human family, a single consciousness? (61)

x v i i i / Understanding

Media

O r again, while telling the parable of the airline executive who
built a little cairn o f pebbles collected f r o m all parts of the w o r l d ,
M c L u h a n makes of his text a lesson about mankind coming home
at last f r o m the exile to w h i c h it had been sentenced by Johann
Gutenberg and the scholars of the Italian Renaissance:
When asked "so what?," he [the airline executive] said that in one
spot one could touch every part of the world because of aviation.
In effect he had hit upon the mosaic or iconic principle of simultaneous touch and interplay that is inherent in the implosive speed
of the airplane. T h e same principle of implosive mosaic is even
more characteristic of electric information movement of all kinds.
(185)

I t is this mystical component of McLuhan's thought that lately
has revived his reputation among the more visionary promoters of
"the Information Superhighway" and the Internet. Journals specific
to the concerns of cyberspace (Wired or T h e Whole Earth Review)
touch on similarly transcendent themes; the authors of the leading
articles talk about the late-twentieth-century substitution of "the
Icon of the N e t for the Icon of the A t o m , " about the virtues of "the
hive m i n d " (its sociability and lack of memory), about the connectedness of "all circuits, all intelligence, all things economic and
ecological," about the revised definitions of self that take account of
mankind's "distributed, headless, emergent wholeness." T h e y echo
McLuhan's dicta about the redemptive powers of art and the coming
to pass of a millennium i n w h i c h , "where the whole man is involved,
there is no w o r k . "
T h e rhetoric falls into the rhythms of what I take to be a kind of
Utopian blank verse, and much of i t seems as overblown as the
bombast arriving f r o m Washington about the beneficence of "the
N e w W o r l d O r d e r " and the great happiness certain to unite the
industrial nations of the earth under the tent of the General Agreement on Tariffs on Trade. T o m y m i n d M c L u h a n is most persuasive
in the secular phases of his hypothesis, when he talks about present
effects instead o f promised reunions. Approached as a guidebook to
the artificial kingdom w i t h i n the glass walls of our communications
technologies, Understanding Media describes the w o r l d that I see and

Introduction to the MIT Press Edition I x\\
know on CBS N e w s , at Disneyland, i n the suburban malls, on the
covers of the fashion magazines—a w o r l d i n which human beings
become commodities (sold on T-shirts or transposed into a series of
digital numbers), a w o r l d i n w h i c h , as Simone Weil once noticed,
" i t is the thing that thinks, and the man w h o is reduced to the state
of the t h i n g , " a w o r l d i n which children find it hard to conceive o f
a time future beyond the immediate and evangelical present, a w o r l d
of people living i n their o w n movies and listening to their o w n
soundtracks, a never-never land where the historical memory counts
for as little as last year's debutante, where the crippled boy wins
the lottery, the chorus girl studies ancient Greek, and the lessons
of experience never contradict the miracles of paradise regained.
T h e w o r l d that M c L u h a n describes has taken shape during m y
o w n lifetime, and w i t h i n the span of m y o w n experience I can
remember that as recently as 1960 it was still possible to make
distinctions between the several forms of what were then known as
the lively arts. T h e audiences recognized the differences between
journalism, literature, politics, and the movies, and it was understood that the novelist wasn't expected to double as an acrobat or a
talk-show host. T h e distinctions blurred under the technical and
epistemological pressures of the next ten years, and as the lines
between fact and fiction became as irrelevant as they were difficult
to distinguish, the lively arts fused into the amalgam of forms known
as the media. News was entertainment, and entertainment was
news, and by 1970 network television was presenting continuous
performances on the stage of events w i t h a repertory company of
high-definition personalities w h o , like the actors i n a Shakespearean
play, easily and abruptly shifted their mise-en-scenes to Dallas,
Vietnam, Chicago, Vienna, Washington, and the Afghan frontier.
T h e special effects were astonishing, and by 1980 McLuhan's theater of celebrity had replaced the old religious theater i n which
Poseidon and Zeus once staged cataclysmic floods and heavenly
fires w i t h the effortless aplomb of ABCs " W i d e World of Sports."
T h e postmodern imagination is a product of the mass media, but
as a means of perception it is more accurately described as preChristian. T h e vocabulary is necessarily primitive, reducing argument to gossip and history to the telling of fairy tales. T h e average

xxl Understanding Media
American household now watches television roughly seven hours a
day (as opposed to five-and-a-half hours a day when M c L u h a n
published Understanding Media) and the soap opera stars receive
thousands of letters a week i n w h i c h the adoring faithful confess
secrets of the heart that they dare not tell their wives, their husbands, or their mothers. Like the old pagan systems of belief, the
mass media grant the primacy of the personal over the impersonal.
Whether i n Washington hearing rooms or H o l l y w o o d restaurants,
names take precedence over things, the actor over the act. Just as
the ancient Greeks assigned trace elements of the divine to trees
and winds and stones (a river G o d sulked and the child drowned;
a sky G o d smiled, and the corn ripened), the modern American
assigns similar powers not only to whales and spotted owls but also
to individuals marked by the aureoles of fame. O n television commercials and subway signs, celebrities of various magnitude, like
the nymphs and satyrs and fauns of ancient m y t h , become the
familiar spirits of automobiles, cameras, computers, and brokerage
firms. Athletes show up on television breathing the gift of life into
whatever products can be carried into a locker room, and aging
movie actresses awaken w i t h their "personal touch" the spirit dormant in the color of a lipstick or a bottle of perfume.
T h e greater images of celebrity posed on the covers of our magazines impart a sense of stability and calm to a w o r l d otherwise
dissolved i n chaos. T h e newspaper headlines bring w o r d of violent
change—war i n Bosnia, near anarchy i n Moscow, famine in Somalia, moral collapse i n Washington—but on the smooth surfaces
of the magazines the faces look as vacant and imperturbable as they
have looked for t w e n t y years, as steady i n their courses as the fixed
stars, as serene as the bronze of Buddha i n the courtyard at Kamakura. There they all are—Liz and Elvis, Madonna and the Kennedys—indifferent to the turmoil of the news, bestowing on the
confusion of events the smiles of infinite bliss. Like minor deities,
or a little crowd of painted idols i n a roadside shrine, they ease the
pain of doubt and hold at bay the fear of death.
As M c L u h a n noticed t h i r t y years ago, the accelerated technologies of the electronic future carry us backward into the firelight
flickering in the caves of a neolithic past. A m o n g people w h o worship the objects of their o w n invention (whether in the shape of the

Introduction to the MIT Press Edition I\x\
fax machine or the high-speed computer) and accept the blessing of
an icon as proof of d i v i n i t y (whether expressed as the Coca-Cola
trademark or as the label on a dress by Donna Karan), ritual becomes a form of applied knowledge. T h e individual voice and singular point of view disappears into the chorus of a corporate and
collective consciousness, w h i c h , in McLuhan's phrase, doesn't "postulate consciousness of anything i n particular." I n place of an energetic politics, we substitute a frenzied spectacle, and the media
set the terms of ritual combat imposed upon the candidates w h o
would prove themselves fit to govern the republic. Medieval chroniclers tell of princesses w h o send Christian knights i n search of
dragons, requiring them to recover bits and pieces of the true cross
and to wander for many days and nights i n heathen forests. T o w a r d
the end of the twentieth century, i n a country that prides itself on
its faith i n reason, American presidents endure the trials by klieg
light and wander for many days and nights i n a labyrinth of Holiday
Inns. T h e presidency undoubtedly constitutes a fearful test of a
man's capacities, but his capacities for what? Even i f the electorate
understood or cared about something as tedious as the mechanics
of government, how does it choose between the rivals for its fealty
and esteem? T h e one attribute that can be known and seen comes
to stand for all the other attributes that remain invisible, and so the
test becomes one o f finding out w h o can survive the stupidity and
pitiless indifference of the television cameras.
H a d M c L u h a n lived long enough to contemplate the media's
delight i n the inspection of Bill Clinton's soul, I expect that he
might have suggested equipping the president w i t h a broadsword
or an old crossbow and sending h i m into the field against four
horsemen i n black armor or an infuriated bear. Assuming that the
event could be properly promoted and attractively staged, I don't
see w h y it wouldn't draw a sizable audience (at least as large as the
one drummed up for Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya H a r d i n g at the
O l y m p i c games), and I can imagine Peter Jennings or Connie Chung
m u r m u r i n g sententious commentary about the president's prior
showings against a l i o n , a N i n j a , and a wolf.
Again as M c L u h a n understood, the habits of m i n d derived f r o m
our use of the mass media—"we become what we behold. . . . We
shape our tools and afterwards our tools shape us"—deconstruct the

x x i i / Understanding Media
texts of a civilization founded on the premise of the printed page.
T o the extent that we abandon the visual order of p r i n t , and w i t h
it the corollary structures of feeling and thought (roads, empires,
straight lines, hierarchy, classification, the novels of George Eliot
or Jane Austen), we discard the idea of the townsman or the citizen
and acquire the sensibilities characteristic of nomadic and pre-literate peoples. T h e t w o sets of circumstance imply different systems
of meaning w h i c h , as w i t h McLuhan's dialectic, also can be expressed as a series of antonyms. Several years ago I had occasion
to compose such a series, and I ' m struck by its nearly exact parallel
w i t h McLuhan's distinction between the technology of the written
word and those of the electronic media. As follows:
Citizen

but also for the reluctance of m y children to believe that I completely and t r u l y exist unless they can see me on television. By
eliminating the dimensions of space and time, the electronic forms
of communication also eliminate the presumption of cause and effect. Typographic man assumed that A follows B, that people w h o
made things—whether cities, ideas, families, or works of a r t —
measured their victories (usually Pyrrhic) over periods of time longer
than those sold to the buyers of beer commercials. Graphic man
imagines himself living i n the enchanted garden of the eternal now.
I f all the w o r l d can be seen simultaneously, and i f all mankind's joy
and suffering is always and everywhere present (if not on C N N or
O p r a h , then on the "Sunday N i g h t M o v i e " or M T V ) , nothing
necessarily follows f r o m anything else. Sequence becomes merely
additive instead of causative. Like the nomadic hordes wandering
across an ancient desert i n search of the soul's oasis, graphic man
embraces the pleasures of barbarism and swears fealty to the sovereignty of the moment.

A f t e r three thousand years o f explosion, b y means o f fragmentary and mechanical technologies, the W e s t e r n w o r l d

w e had extended our bodies i n space. T o day, after more than a century o f elect r i c technology, w e have extended o u r
central nervous system itself i n a global
embrace, abolishing b o t h space and time
as far as our planet is concerned. R a p i d l y ,

porately extended to the w h o l e o f human society, m u c h as w e
have already extended our senses and our nerves b y the various
media. W h e t h e r the extension of consciousness, so l o n g sought
b y advertisers f o r specific products, w i l l be "a good t h i n g " is a
question that admits o f a w i d e solution. T h e r e is little possibility
of answering such questions about the extensions o f man w i t h o u t
considering all o f t h e m together. A n y extension, whether o f skin,
hand, or f o o t , affects the w h o l e psychic and social complex.
Some o f the principal extensions, together w i t h some of their
psychic and social consequences, are studied i n this book. Just
h o w l i t t l e consideration has been given to such matters i n the
past can be gathered f r o m the consternation o f one o f the editors
of this book. H e noted i n dismay that "seventy-five per cent of
y o u r material is new. A successful book cannot venture to be
more than ten per cent n e w . " Such a risk seems quite w o r t h taking
at the present t i m e w h e n the stakes are v e r y high, and the need t o
understand the effects of the extensions o f man becomes more u r gent b y the hour.
I n the mechanical age n o w receding, many actions could be
taken w i t h o u t too m u c h concern. Slow movement insured that
the reactions w e r e delayed f o r considerable periods o f time.
T o d a y the action and the reaction occur almost at the same time.
W e actually live m y t h i c a l l y and integrally, as i t were, b u t w e
continue t o t h i n k i n the o l d , fragmented space and t i m e patterns
of the pre-electric age.
W e s t e r n man acquired f r o m the technology of literacy the
p o w e r t o act w i t h o u t reacting. T h e advantages o f fragmenting
himself i n this w a y are seen i n the case o f the surgeon w h o w o u l d
be quite helpless i f he were t o become humanly involved i n his
operation. W e acquired the art o f c a r r y i n g o u t the most dangerous social operations w i t h complete detachment. B u t our detachment was a posture o f noninvolvement. I n the electric age,
w h e n our central nervous system is technologically extended to
involve us i n the w h o l e of m a n k i n d and t o incorporate the whole
of mankind i n us, w e necessarily participate, i n depth, i n the
consequences o f our every action. I t is no longer possible to adopt
the aloof and dissociated role o f the literate Westerner.

Introduction/S
T h e Theater o f the A b s u r d dramatizes this recent dilemma o f
Western man, the man o f action w h o appears n o t to be involved
i n the action. Such is the o r i g i n and appeal o f Samuel Beckett's
clowns. A f t e r three thousand years of specialist explosion and o f
increasing specialism and alienation i n the technological extensions
o f our bodies, our w o r l d has become compressional b y dramatic
reversal. As electrically contracted, the globe is no more than a
village. Electric speed i n b r i n g i n g all social and political functions
together i n a sudden implosion has heightened human awareness
o f responsibility t o an intense degree. I t is this implosive factor
that alters the position o f the N e g r o , the teen-ager, and some other
groups. T h e y can no longer be contained, i n the political sense o f
limited association. T h e y are n o w involved i n our lives, as w e i n
theirs, thanks to the electric media.
T h i s is the A g e o f A n x i e t y f o r the reason of the electric
implosion that compels commitment and participation, quite regardless o f any " p o i n t of v i e w . " T h e partial and specialized
character o f the v i e w p o i n t , however noble, w i l l n o t serve at all
i n the electric age. A t the i n f o r m a t i o n level the same upset has
occurred w i t h the substitution o f the inclusive image f o r the
mere viewpoint. I f the nineteenth c e n t u r y was the age of the
editorial chair, ours is the century o f the psychiatrist's couch.
As extension o f man the chair is a specialist ablation of the posterior, a sort of ablative absolute of backside, whereas the couch
extends the integral being. T h e psychiatrist employs the couch,
since i t removes the temptation t o express private points o f v i e w
and obviates the need t o rationalize events.
T h e aspiration o f our time f o r wholeness, empathy and depth
o f awareness is a natural adjunct o f electric technology. T h e age
o f mechanical i n d u s t r y that preceded us f o u n d vehement assert i o n o f private o u t l o o k the natural mode o f expression. E v e r y c u l ture and every age has its favorite model o f perception and
knowledge that i t is inclined t o prescribe f o r everybody and everyt h i n g . T h e mark o f o u r time is its revulsion against imposed
patterns. W e are suddenly eager t o have things and people declare their beings t o t a l l y . T h e r e is a deep f a i t h t o be f o u n d i n this
new attitude—a faith that concerns the ultimate harmony o f all

being. Such is the faith i n w h i c h this book has been w r i t t e n . I t
explores the contours o f our o w n extended beings i n our technologies, seeking the principle o f i n t e l l i g i b i l i t y i n each o f them.
I n the f u l l confidence that i t is possible t o w i n an understanding
o f these forms that w i l l b r i n g them into o r d e r l y service, I have
looked at them anew, accepting v e r y little of the conventional
wisdom concerning them. One can say o f media as R o b e r t T h e o bald has said o f economic depressions: " T h e r e is one additional
factor that has helped to c o n t r o l depressions, and that is a better
understanding of their development." Examination of the origin
and development o f the individual extensions o f man should be
preceded b y a look at some general aspects of the media, or
extensions o f man, beginning w i t h the never-explained numbness
that each extension brings about i n the individual and society.

1
The Medium
Is the
Message

I n a culture like ours, l o n g accustomed t o
splitting and d i v i d i n g all things as a means
o f c o n t r o l , i t is sometimes a b i t o f a shock
t o be reminded that, i n operational and
practical fact, the medium is the message.
T h i s is merely t o say that the personal and
social consequences o f any medium—that
is, o f any extension of ourselves—result
f r o m the new scale that is introduced into
our affairs b y each extension of ourselves,
or b y any n e w technology. T h u s , w i t h
automation, f o r example, the new patterns
o f human association tend t o eliminate
jobs, i t is true. T h a t is the negative result.
Positively, automation creates roles f o r
people, w h i c h is t o say depth o f involvement i n their w o r k and human association
that our preceding mechanical technolo g y had destroyed. M a n y people w o u l d
be disposed t o say that i t was n o t the
machine, b u t w h a t one d i d w i t h the machine, that was its meaning or message.
I n terms of the ways i n w h i c h the machine

8/'Understanding

Media

altered our relations t o one another and to ourselves, i t mattered
n o t i n the least whether i t t u r n e d o u t cornflakes or Cadillacs. T h e
restructuring o f human w o r k and association was shaped b y the
technique o f fragmentation that is the essence o f machine technology. T h e essence o f automation technology is the opposite. I t is
integral and decentralist i n depth, just as the machine was f r a g mentary, centralist, and superficial i n its patterning of human
relationships.
T h e instance o f the electric l i g h t m a y prove illuminating i n
this connection. T h e electric l i g h t is pure i n f o r m a t i o n . I t is a
medium w i t h o u t a message, as i t were, unless i t is used t o spell out
some verbal ad or name. T h i s fact, characteristic o f all media,
means that the " c o n t e n t " o f any medium is always another
medium. T h e content o f w r i t i n g is speech, just as the w r i t t e n
w o r d is the content o f p r i n t , and p r i n t is the content o f the
telegraph. I f i t is asked, " W h a t is the content o f speech?," i t is
necessary t o say, " I t is an actual process o f thought, w h i c h is
i n itself nonverbal." A n abstract painting represents direct manifestation o f creative t h o u g h t processes as they m i g h t appear i n
computer designs. W h a t w e are considering here, however, are the
psychic and social consequences o f the designs or patterns as they
a m p l i f y or accelerate existing processes. For the "message" of any
medium or technology is the change o f scale or pace or pattern
that i t introduces i n t o human affairs. T h e r a i l w a y d i d n o t i n t r o duce movement or transportation or wheel or road into human
society, b u t i t accelerated and enlarged the scale of previous
human functions, creating t o t a l l y new kinds o f cities and new
kinds o f w o r k and leisure. T h i s happened whether the r a i l w a y
functioned i n a tropical or a n o r t h e r n environment, and is quite
independent o f the f r e i g h t o r content o f the r a i l w a y medium.
T h e airplane, o n the other hand, b y accelerating the rate o f transportation, tends t o dissolve the r a i l w a y f o r m o f c i t y , politics,
and association, quite independently o f w h a t the airplane is used
for.
L e t us r e t u r n to the electric light. W h e t h e r the l i g h t is being
used f o r brain surgery or n i g h t baseball is a matter o f indifference.

I t could be argued that these activities are i n some w a y the " c o n t e n t " o f the electric l i g h t , since they c o u l d n o t exist w i t h o u t the
electric light. T h i s fact merely underlines the p o i n t that "the
medium is the message" because i t is the m e d i u m that shapes and
controls the scale and f o r m o f human association and action. T h e
content or uses o f such media are as diverse as they are ineffectual
in shaping the f o r m o f human association. Indeed, i t is o n l y too
typical that the " c o n t e n t " o f any m e d i u m blinds us t o the character o f the medium. I t is o n l y today that industries have become
aware o f the various kinds o f business i n w h i c h t h e y are engaged.
W h e n I B M discovered that i t was n o t i n the business o f making
office equipment or business machines, b u t that i t was i n the
business o f processing i n f o r m a t i o n , then i t began to navigate w i t h
clear vision. T h e General Electric Company makes a considerable
p o r t i o n o f its profits f r o m electric l i g h t bulbs and l i g h t i n g systems.
I t has n o t y e t discovered that, quite as m u c h as A . T . & T . , i t is i n
the business of m o v i n g i n f o r m a t i o n .
T h e electric l i g h t escapes attention as a communication
medium just because i t has no "content." A n d this makes i t an
invaluable instance o f h o w people fail t o study media at all. F o r
i t is n o t t i l l the electric l i g h t is used t o spell out some brand
name that i t is noticed as a medium. T h e n i t is n o t the l i g h t b u t
the " c o n t e n t " ( o r w h a t is really another m e d i u m ) that is noticed.
T h e message o f the electric l i g h t is l i k e the message o f electric
p o w e r i n industry, t o t a l l y radical, pervasive, and decentralized.
F o r electric light and p o w e r are separate f r o m their uses, y e t t h e y
eliminate time and space factors i n human association exactly as
do radio, telegraph, telephone, and T V , creating involvement
i n depth.

I n Othello, w h i c h , as m u c h as King Lear, is concerned w i t h

10/Understanding

lines that bespeak Shakespeare's i n t u i t i o n o f the transforming
powers of n e w media:
Is there not charms
By which the property of youth and maidhood
May be abus'd? Have y o u not read Roderigo,
O f some such thing?
I n Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida, w h i c h is almost completely
devoted t o b o t h a psychic and social study of communication,
Shakespeare states his awareness that true social and political
navigation depend u p o n anticipating the consequences of i n novation:
The providence that's i n a watchful state
Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,
Finds bottom i n the uncomprehensive deeps,
Keeps place w i t h thought, and almost like the gods
Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
T h e increasing awareness o f the action o f media, quite i n dependently of their " c o n t e n t " or p r o g r a m m i n g , was indicated
i n the annoyed and anonymous stanza:
I n modern thought, ( i f not i n fact)
Nothing is that doesn't act,
So that is reckoned wisdom which
Describes the scratch but not the itch.
T h e same k i n d o f total, configurational awareness that reveals
w h y the m e d i u m is socially the message has occurred i n the
most recent and radical medical theories. I n his Stress of Life, Hans
Selye tells of the dismay o f a research colleague o n hearing o f
Selye's t h e o r y :
W h e n he saw me thus launched on yet another enraptured
description of what I had observed i n animals treated w i t h
this or that impure, toxic material, he looked at me w i t h
desperately sad eyes and said i n obvious despair: "But Selye,
t r y to realize what you are doing before i t is too late! You
have now decided to spend your entire life studying the
pharmacology of d i r t ! "
(Hans Selye, The Stress of Life)

The

Message/II

As Selye deals w i t h the total environmental situation i n his
"stress" theory o f disease, so the latest approach t o media study
considers not o n l y the " c o n t e n t " b u t the m e d i u m and the cultural
matrix w i t h i n w h i c h the particular m e d i u m operates. T h e older
unawareness of the psychic and social effects o f media can be
illustrated f r o m almost any o f the conventional pronouncements.
I n accepting an honorary degree f r o m the U n i v e r s i t y o f N o t r e
Dame a f e w years ago, General D a v i d SarnofF made this statement: " W e are too prone t o make technological instruments the
scapegoats f o r the sins o f those w h o w i e l d them. T h e products
o f modern science are n o t i n themselves good or bad; i t is the w a y
they are used that determines their value." T h a t is the voice o f the
current somnambulism. Suppose w e were t o say, " A p p l e pie is i n
itself neither good nor bad; i t is the w a y i t is used that determines
its value." O r , " T h e smallpox virus is i n itself neither good n o r
bad; i t is the w a y i t is used that determines its value." A g a i n ,
"Firearms are i n themselves neither good nor bad; i t is the w a y
they are used that determines their value." T h a t is, i f the slugs
reach the r i g h t people firearms are good. I f the T V tube fires the
r i g h t ammunition at the r i g h t people i t is good. I am n o t being
perverse. T h e r e is s i m p l y n o t h i n g i n the Sarnoff statement that
w i l l bear scrutiny, f o r i t ignores the nature o f the medium, o f
any and all media, i n the true Narcissus style o f one hypnotized b y
the amputation and extension o f his o w n being i n a n e w technical
f o r m ! General Sarnoff w e n t o n t o explain his attitude t o the
technology of p r i n t , saying that i t was true that p r i n t caused m u c h
trash t o circulate, b u t i t had also disseminated the Bible and the
thoughts o f seers and philosophers. I t has never occurred t o
General Sarnoff that any technology c o u l d do a n y t h i n g b u t add

Such economists as Robert Theobald, W . W . Rostow, and
John Kenneth Galbraith have been explaining f o r years h o w i t

A n d the paradox o f mechanization is that although i t is itself the

process and b y p u t t i n g the fragmented parts i n a series. Yet, as
D a v i d H u m e showed i n the eighteenth century, there is no
principle o f causality i n a mere sequence. T h a t one t h i n g follows
another accounts f o r n o t h i n g . N o t h i n g f o l l o w s f r o m f o l l o w i n g ,
except change. So the greatest o f all reversals occurred w i t h
electricity, that ended sequence b y making things instant. W i t h
instant speed the causes o f things began t o emerge t o awareness
again, as they had n o t done w i t h things i n sequence and i n
concatenation accordingly. Instead o f asking w h i c h came first, the
chicken o r the egg, i t suddenly seemed that a chicken was an
egg's idea f o r getting more eggs.
Just before an airplane breaks the sound barrier, sound
waves become visible o n the wings of the plane. T h e sudden
visibility o f sound just as sound ends is an apt instance of that
great pattern o f being that reveals new and opposite forms
just as the earlier forms reach their peak performance. Mechanization was never so v i v i d l y fragmented or sequential as i n
the b i r t h o f the movies, the moment that translated us beyond
mechanism i n t o the w o r l d o f g r o w t h and organic interrelation.
T h e movie, b y sheer speeding u p the mechanical, carried us f r o m
the w o r l d o f sequence and connections i n t o the w o r l d o f creative
configuration and structure. T h e message o f the movie medium
is that o f transition f r o m lineal connections t o configurations. I t
is the transition that produced the n o w quite correct observation:
" I f i t w o r k s , it's obsolete." W h e n electric speed f u r t h e r takes
over f r o m mechanical movie sequences, then the lines o f force
i n structures and i n media become l o u d and clear. W e r e t u r n t o

T o a h i g h l y literate and mechanized culture the movie appeared as a w o r l d o f t r i u m p h a n t illusions and dreams that money
could b u y . I t was at this m o m e n t o f the movie that cubism occurred, and i t has been described b y E. H . G o m b r i c h (Art and
Illusion) as " t h e most radical attempt t o stamp out ambiguity and
t o enforce one reading of the picture—that o f a man-made construction, a colored canvas." F o r cubism substitutes all facets of
an object simultaneously f o r the " p o i n t o f v i e w " or facet o f perspective illusion. Instead o f the specialized illusion o f the t h i r d

The

dimension on canvas, cubism sets up an interplay o f planes and
contradiction or dramatic conflict o f patterns, lights, textures
that "drives home the message" b y involvement. T h i s is held b y
many to be an exercise i n painting, n o t i n illusion.
I n other words, cubism, b y giving the inside and outside, the
top, b o t t o m , back, and f r o n t and the rest, i n t w o dimensions, drops
the illusion of perspective i n favor o f instant sensory awareness o f
the w h o l e . Cubism, b y seizing o n instant total awareness, suddenly
announced that the medium is the message. Is i t n o t evident that
the moment that sequence yields t o the simultaneous, one is i n the
w o r l d o f the structure and o f configuration? Is that n o t w h a t has
happened i n physics as i n painting, p o e t r y , and i n communication?
Specialized segments o f attention have shifted t o total field, and w e
can n o w say, " T h e m e d i u m is the message" quite naturally. Before
the electric speed and t o t a l field, i t was n o t obvious that the
medium is the message. T h e message, i t seemed, was the " c o n t e n t , " as people used t o ask w h a t a painting was abotét. Y e t t h e y
never thought to ask w h a t a melody was about, nor w h a t a house
or a dress was about. I n such matters, people retained some sense
of the w h o l e pattern, o f f o r m and f u n c t i o n as a u n i t y . B u t i n the
electric age this integral idea o f structure and configuration has
become so prevalent that educational t h e o r y has taken u p the
matter. Instead o f w o r k i n g w i t h specialized "problems" i n a r i t h metic, the structural approach n o w f o l l o w s the linea o f force i n

open book t o de Tocqueville because he had learned the grammar

was asked w h y he d i d n o t w r i t e a book o n England, since he
k n e w and admired England. H e replied:
One would have to have an unusual degree of philosophical
folly to believe oneself able to judge England i n six months.
A year always seemed to me too short a time i n which to
appreciate the United States properly, and i t is much easier
to acquire clear and precise notions about the American
Union than about Great Britain. I n America all laws derive
in a sense f r o m the same line of thought. The whole of
society, so to speak, is founded upon a single fact; everything springs f r o m a simple principle. One could compare
America to a forest pierced by a multitude of straight roads
all converging on the same point. One has only to find the
center and everything is revealed at a glance. But i n England
the paths r u n criss-cross, and i t is only by travelling down
each one of them that one can build up a picture of the whole.
D e Tocqueville, i n earlier w o r k o n the French Revolution, had
explained h o w i t was the p r i n t e d w o r d that, achieving cultural
saturation i n the eighteenth century, had homogenized the French
nation. Frenchmen were the same k i n d o f people f r o m n o r t h t o
south. T h e typographic principles o f u n i f o r m i t y , c o n t i n u i t y , and
lineality had overlaid the complexities of ancient feudal and oral
society. T h e Revolution was carried o u t b y the n e w literati and
lawyers.
I n England, however, such was the power of the ancient oral
traditions o f c o m m o n law, backed b y the medieval institution
o f Parliament, that no u n i f o r m i t y or c o n t i n u i t y o f the n e w visual
p r i n t culture could take complete hold. T h e result was that the
most i m p o r t a n t event i n English history has never taken place;
namely, the English Revolution o n the lines of the French Revolut i o n . T h e A m e r i c a n Revolution had no medieval legal institutions
t o discard or t o r o o t out, apart f r o m monarchy. A n d many have
held that the A m e r i c a n Presidency has become v e r y m u c h more
personal and monarchical than any European monarch ever
could be.

creating u n i f o r m i t y and c o n t i n u i t y . England, he says, has rejected
this principle and clung t o the dynamic or oral common-law
tradition. Hence the discontinuity and unpredictable quality o f
English culture. T h e grammar o f p r i n t cannot help t o construe
the message of oral and n o n w r i t t e n culture and institutions. T h e
English aristocracy was p r o p e r l y classified as barbarian b y
M a t t h e w A r n o l d because its power and status had n o t h i n g t o do

electric age, and is o n l y incidentally related t o Europe or the
Orient. T h e ultimate conflict between sight and sound, between
w r i t t e n and oral kinds o f perception and organization o f existence
is u p o n us. Since understanding stops action, as Nietzsche observed, w e can moderate the fierceness o f this conflict b y understanding the media that extend us and raise these wars w i t h i n and
w i t h o u t us.
Detribalization b y literacy and its traumatic effects o n tribal
man is the theme o f a book b y the psychiatrist J. C. Carothers,
The African Mind in Health and Disease ( W o r l d H e a l t h O r g a n i zation, Geneva, 1953). M u c h o f his material appeared i n an article
i n Psychiatry
magazine, November, 1 9 5 9 : " T h e Culture, Psychiatry, and the W r i t t e n W o r d . " A g a i n , i t is electric speed that
has revealed the lines o f force operating f r o m W e s t e r n technology

is the Bedouin w i t h his battery radio o n board the camel. Subm e r g i n g natives w i t h floods o f concepts f o r w h i c h n o t h i n g has

isolation. W e are as n u m b i n our n e w electric w o r l d as the

Electric speed mingles the cultures o f prehistory w i t h the
dregs o f industrial marketeers, the nonliterate w i t h the semiliterate
and the postliterate. M e n t a l b r e a k d o w n o f v a r y i n g degrees is the

the American w a y of life was f o r m e d . I t is, however, no time t o
suggest strategies w h e n the threat has n o t even been a c k n o w l edged t o exist. I am i n the position o f Louis Pasteur telling doctors
that their greatest enemy was quite invisible, and quite unrecognized b y them. O u r conventional response to all media, namely
that i t is h o w they are used that counts, is the numb stance of the
technological idiot. For the " c o n t e n t " of a m e d i u m is like the
j u i c y piece o f meat carried b y the burglar t o distract the w a t c h dog o f the m i n d . T h e effect o f the medium is made strong and
intense just because i t is given another medium as "content." T h e
content o f a movie is a novel or a play or an opera. T h e effect of
the movie f o r m is not related t o its program content. T h e " c o n t e n t " o f w r i t i n g or p r i n t is speech, b u t the reader is almost entirely
unaware either of p r i n t or o f speech.
A r n o l d T o y n b e e is innocent o f any understanding o f media
as they have shaped history, b u t he is f u l l of examples that the
student o f media can use. A t one moment he can seriously suggest
that adult education, such as the W o r k e r s Educational Associat i o n i n Britain, is a useful counterforce t o the popular press. T o y n bee considers that although all o f the oriental societies have i n our
time accepted the industrial technology and its political consequences: " O n the cultural plane, however, there is no u n i f o r m
corresponding tendency." (Somervell, I . 267) T h i s is like the voice
of the literate man, floundering i n a milieu of ads, w h o boasts,
"Personally, I pay no attention to ads." T h e spiritual and cultural
reservations that the oriental peoples may have t o w a r d our technology w i l l avail them not at all. T h e effects of technology do not
occur at the level of opinions or concepts, b u t alter sense ratios
or patterns o f perception steadily and w i t h o u t any resistance. T h e
serious artist is the o n l y person able t o encounter technology
w i t h i m p u n i t y , just because he is an expert aware o f the changes
i n sense perception.

ignoring the effect o f the challenge o f these forms u p o n the response of our senses. H e imagines that i t is the response of our
opinions that is relevant t o the effect o f media and technology i n
society, a " p o i n t of v i e w " that is plainly the result of the t y p o graphic spell. For the man i n a literate and homogenized society

charge.
Leonard D o o b , i n his report Communication
in
Africa,
tells of one A f r i c a n w h o t o o k great pains t o listen each evening
t o the BBC news, even t h o u g h he could understand n o t h i n g of
i t . Just t o be i n the presence of those sounds at 7 P . M . each day
was i m p o r t a n t f o r h i m . H i s attitude to speech was like ours t o
melody—the resonant intonation was meaning enough. I n the
seventeenth century our ancestors still shared this native's attitude
t o the forms o f media, as is plain i n the f o l l o w i n g sentiment o f
the Frenchman Bernard L a m expressed i n The Art of
Speaking
( L o n d o n , 1696):
'Tis an effect of the Wisdom of God, who created Man to
be happy, that whatever is useful to his conversation (way of
life) is agreeable to him . . . because all victual that conduces to nourishment is relishable, whereas other things that
cannot be assimulated and be turned into our substance are
insipid. A Discourse cannot be pleasant to the Hearer that
is not easie to the Speaker; nor can i t be easily pronounced
unless i t be heard w i t h delight.
H e r e is an equilibrium t h e o r y of human diet and expression such
as even n o w w e are o n l y striving t o w o r k o u t again f o r media
after centuries o f fragmentation and specialism.
Pope Pius X I I was deeply concerned that there be serious
study o f the media today. O n February 17, 1950, he said:
I t is not an exaggeration to say that the future of modern
society and the stability of its inner life depend i n large part
on the maintenance of an equilibrium between the strength
of the techniques of communication and the capacity of the
individual's own reaction.
Failure i n this respect has f o r centuries been t y p i c a l and total
f o r m a n k i n d . Subliminal and docile acceptance o f media impact
has made them prisons w i t h o u t walls f o r their human users. As

w i t h w h i c h to clobber other media and other groups. T h e result
is that the present age has been one o f multiple civil wars that

Human Progress, Professor J. U . N e f declared: " T h e total wars
of our time have been the result of a series o f intellectual misrakes . . . "
I f the formative p o w e r i n the media are the media themselves,
that raises a host o f large matters that can o n l y be mentioned
here, although t h e y deserve volumes. N a m e l y , that technological
media are staples or natural resources, exactly as are coal and
cotton and o i l . A n y b o d y w i l l concede that society whose econo m y is dependent u p o n one or t w o major staples like c o t t o n ,
or grain, or lumber, or fish, or cattle is going to have some o b vious social patterns o f organization as a result. Stress o n a f e w
major staples creates extreme instability i n the economy b u t great
endurance i n the population. T h e pathos and humor o f the A m e r i can South are embedded i n such an economy of limited staples.
For a society configured b y reliance o n a f e w commodities accepts
them as a social b o n d quite as m u c h as the metropolis does the
press. C o t t o n and o i l , like radio and T V , become " f i x e d charges"
on the entire psychic life o f the c o m m u n i t y . A n d this pervasive
fact creates the unique cultural flavor o f any society. I t pays
through the nose and all its other senses f o r each staple that shapes
its life.
T h a t our human senses, o f w h i c h all media are extensions, are
also fixed charges on our personal energies, and that t h e y also
configure the awareness and experience o f each one o f us, m a y be
perceived i n another connection mentioned b y the psychologist
C. G . Jung:
Every Roman was surrounded by slaves. The slave and his
psychology flooded ancient Italy, and every Roman became
inwardly, and of course unwittingly, a slave. Because living
constantly in the atmosphere of slaves, he became infected
through the unconscious w i t h their psychology. N o one can
shield himself f r o m such an influence (Contributions to Analytical Psychology, London, 1928).

" T h e rise of the w a l t z , " explained C u r t

"was a result of that longing f o r t r u t h ,
simplicity, closeness to nature, and p r i m i tivism, w h i c h the last t w o - t h i r d s o f the
eighteenth century f u l f i l l e d . " I n the cent u r y of jazz w e are l i k e l y t o overlook the
emergence of the waltz as a h o t and explosive human expression that broke

T h e r e is a basic principle that distinguishes a h o t medium like radio f r o m a
cool one like the telephone, or a hot med i u m like the movie f r o m a cool one
like T V . A hot medium is one that extends
one single sense i n " h i g h definition." H i g h
definition is the state of being w e l l filled
w i t h data. A photograph is, visually, " h i g h
definition." A cartoon is " l o w definition,"
simply because v e r y little visual informat i o n is provided. Telephone is a cool
medium, or one o f l o w definition, because

t h e car is given a meager amount of i n f o r m a t i o n . A n d speech is
:i c o o l medium o f l o w definition, because so little is given and so
much has to be filled i n b y the listener. O n the other hand, h o t
media do not leave so m u c h t o be filled i n or completed b y the
:mdicnce. H o t media are, therefore, l o w i n participation, and
c o o l media are high i n participation or completion b y the
;nidicnce. N a t u r a l l y , therefore, a hot medium like radio has v e r y
different effects o n the user f r o m a cool m e d i u m like the telephone.
A cool medium like hieroglyphic or ideogrammic w r i t t e n
characters has v e r y different effects f r o m the h o t and explosive
medium of the phonetic alphabet. T h e alphabet, w h e n pushed t o
;i high degree of abstract visual intensity, became t y p o g r a p h y .
I l i e printed w o r d w i t h its specialist intensity burst the bonds o f
medieval corporate guilds and monasteries, creating extreme
individualist patterns o f enterprise and m o n o p o l y . B u t the t y p i c a l

T h e heavy and u n w i e l d y media, such as stone, are time binders.
Used f o r w r i t i n g , they are v e r y cool indeed, and serve t o u n i f y the
;iges; whereas paper is a hot medium that serves t o u n i f y spaces
horizontally, b o t h i n political and entertainment empires.
A n y hot medium allows of less participation than a cool
one, as a lecture makes f o r less participation than a seminar, and
a book f o r less than dialogue. W i t h p r i n t m a n y earlier forms were
excluded f r o m life and art, and many were given strange n e w
intensity. But our o w n time is c r o w d e d w i t h examples o f the p r i n ciple that the hot f o r m excludes, and the cool one includes. W h e n
ballerinas began t o dance o n their toes a c e n t u r y ago, i t was
felt that the art o f the ballet had acquired a new " s p i r i t u a l i t y . "
W i t h this new intensity, male figures were excluded f r o m ballet.

of industrial specialism and the explosion o f home functions i n t o
laundries, bakeries, and hospitals o n the periphery o f the c o m m u n i t y . Intensity or h i g h definition engenders specialism and

fragmentation i n l i v i n g as i n entertainment, w h i c h explains w h y
any intense experience must be " f o r g o t t e n , " "censored," and reduced t o a v e r y cool state before i t can be "learned" or assimilated.
T h e Freudian "censor" is less o f a m o r a l f u n c t i o n than an indispensable c o n d i t i o n of learning. W e r e w e t o accept f u l l y and
directly every shock t o our various structures of awareness, w e
w o u l d soon be nervous wrecks, doing double-takes and pressing
panic buttons every minute. T h e "censor" protects our central
system of values, as i t does our physical nervous system b y simply
cooling off the onset of experience a great deal. F o r m a n y people,
this cooling system brings on a lifelong state o f psychic rigor
mortis, or of somnambulism, particularly observable i n periods of
new technology.
A n example of the disruptive impact o f a h o t technology
succeeding a cool one is given b y R o b e r t Theobald i n The
Rich
and the Poor. W h e n Australian natives were given steel axes b y
the missionaries, their culture, based o n the stone axe, collapsed.
T h e stone axe had n o t o n l y been scarce b u t had always been a
basic status symbol o f male importance. T h e missionaries provided
quantities of sharp steel axes and gave t h e m t o w o m e n and children.
T h e men had even t o b o r r o w these f r o m the w o m e n , causing a
collapse o f male d i g n i t y . A tribal and feudal hierarchy o f traditional k i n d collapses q u i c k l y w h e n i t meets any h o t m e d i u m of

Mil poets like Blake were far ahead of N e w t o n i n their response
i<> ilie challenge of the clock. Blake spoke o f the need to be
delivered " f r o m single vision and N e w t o n ' s sleep," k n o w i n g v e r y
w e l l that N e w t o n ' s response t o the challenge o f the new mechan i s m was itself merely a mechanical repetition of the challenge.
Make saw N e w t o n and L o c k e and others as hypnotized Narcissus
iv pes quite unable t o meet the challenge of mechanism. W . B.
Yeats gave the f u l l Blakean version of N e w t o n and Locke i n a
famous epigram:
Locke sank into a swoon;
The garden died;
God took the spinning jenny
Out of his side.
Yeats presents Locke, the philosopher o f mechanical and lineal
associationism, as hypnotized b y his o w n image. T h e "garden,"
or unified consciousness, ended. Eighteenth-century man g o t an
extension of himself i n the f o r m o f the spinning machine that
Yeats endows w i t h its f u l l sexual significance. W o m a n , herself,
is thus seen as a technological extension of man's being.
Blake's counterstrategy f o r his age was t o meet mechanism
w i t h organic m y t h . T o d a y , deep i n the electric age, organic m y t h
is itself a simple and automatic response capable o f mathematical
formulation and expression, w i t h o u t any o f the imaginative
perception of Blake about i t . H a d he encountered the electric
age, Blake w o u l d n o t have met its challenge w i t h a mere repetition o f electric f o r m . F o r m y t h is the instant vision o f a complex
process that ordinarily extends over a l o n g period. M y t h is
contraction or implosion o f any process, and the instant speed
of electricity confers the m y t h i c dimension o n ordinary industrial
and social action today. W e live m y t h i c a l l y b u t continue to t h i n k
fragmentarily and on single planes.
Scholars today are acutely aware of a discrepancy between
their ways of treating subjects and the subject itself. Scriptural
scholars o f b o t h the O l d and N e w Testaments f r e q u e n t l y say that
while their treatment must be linear, the subject is not. T h e
subject treats o f the relations between G o d and man, and between

26/Understanding

Media

G o d and the w o r l d , and o f the relations between man and his
neighbor—all these subsist together, and act and react upon one
another at the same time. T h e H e b r e w and Eastern mode o f
thought tackles problem and resolution, at the outset o f a discussion, i n a w a y typical o f oral societies i n general. T h e entire
message is then traced and retraced, again and again, on the
rounds o f a concentric spiral w i t h seeming redundancy. One can
stop anywhere after the first f e w sentences and have the f u l l
message, i f one is prepared t o " d i g " i t . T h i s k i n d o f plan seems to
have inspired Frank L l o y d W r i g h t i n designing the Guggenheim
A r t G a l l e r y o n a spiral, concentric basis. I t is a redundant f o r m
inevitable t o the electric age, i n w h i c h the concentric pattern is
imposed b y the instant quality, and overlay i n depth, of electric
speed. B u t the concentric w i t h its endless intersection of planes
is necessary f o r insight. I n fact, i t is the technique of insight, and
as such is necessary f o r media study, since no m e d i u m has its
meaning o r existence alone, b u t o n l y i n constant interplay w i t h
other media.
T h e n e w electric structuring and configuring o f life more
and more encounters the o l d lineal and fragmentary procedures
and tools o f analysis f r o m the mechanical age. M o r e and more w e
t u r n f r o m the content of messages t o study total effect. Kenneth
Boulding p u t this matter i n The Image b y saying, " T h e meaning
o f a message is the change w h i c h i t produces i n the image."
Concern w i t h effect rather than meaning is a basic change of our
electric time, f o r effect involves the total situation, and n o t a single
level o f i n f o r m a t i o n movement. Strangely, there is recognition
o f this matter o f effect rather than i n f o r m a t i o n i n the British
idea o f libel: " T h e greater the t r u t h , the greater the l i b e l . "
T h e effect o f electric technology had at first been anxiety.
N o w i t appears t o create boredom. W e have been t h r o u g h the
three stages o f alarm, resistance, and exhaustion that occur i n
every disease or stress o f life, whether individual or collective.
A t least, our exhausted slump after the first encounter w i t h the
electric has inclined us to expect n e w problems. H o w e v e r , backw a r d countries that have experienced little permeation w i t h our
o w n mechanical and specialist culture are m u c h better able t o con-

f r o n t and to understand electric technology. N o t o n l y have
backward and nonindustrial cultures no specialist habits t o overcome i n their encounter w i t h electromagnetism, b u t they have
still m u c h of their traditional oral culture that has the total,
unified " f i e l d " character of our new electromagnetism. O u r o l d
industrialized areas, having eroded their oral traditions automatically, are i n the position o f having t o rediscover them i n order to
cope w i t h the electric age.
I n terms of the theme of media hot and cold, backward countries are cool, and w e are hot. T h e " c i t y slicker" is hot, and
the rustic is cool. B u t i n terms of the reversal o f procedures and
values i n the electric age, the past mechanical time was hot, and
we of the T V age are cool. T h e waltz was a hot, fast mechanical
dance suited to the industrial time i n its moods of pomp and c i r cumstance. I n contrast, the T w i s t is a cool, involved and chatty
f o r m of improvised gesture. T h e jazz o f the period of the hot
new media o f movie and radio was hot jazz. Y e t jazz of itself tends
to be a casual dialogue f o r m of dance quite lacking i n the repetitive and mechanical forms of the waltz. Cool jazz came i n quite
naturally after the first impact of radio and movie had been absorbed.
I n the special Russian issue o f Life magazine f o r September
13, 1963, i t is mentioned i n Russian restaurants and night clubs,
" t h o u g h the Charleston is tolerated, the T w i s t is taboo." A l l
this is to say that a c o u n t r y i n the process o f industrialization is
inclined to regard hot jazz as consistent w i t h its developing p r o grams. T h e cool and involved f o r m o f the T w i s t , on the other
hand, w o u l d strike such a culture at once as retrograde and i n compatible w i t h its n e w mechanical stress. T h e Charleston, w i t h
its aspect of a mechanical doll agitated b y strings, appears i n Russia
as an avant-garde f o r m . W e , on the other hand, find the avantgarde i n the cool and the primitive, w i t h its promise o f depth i n volvement and integral expression.
T h e " h a r d " sell and the " h o t " line become mere comedy i n
the T V age, and the death o f all the salesmen at one stroke of the
T V axe has turned the h o t American culture into a cool one that

many complaints about society having t o move too fast t o keep
up w i t h the machine. There is great advantage i n m o v i n g fast i f
y o u move completely, i f social, educational, and recreational
changes keep pace. Y o u must change the w h o l e pattern at once
and the w h o l e group together—and the people themselves must
decide t o m o v e . "
Margaret Mead is t h i n k i n g here of change as u n i f o r m speedup of m o t i o n or a u n i f o r m h o t t i n g - u p of temperatures i n backw a r d societies. W e are certainly c o m i n g w i t h i n conceivable range

T h r o u g h o u t The City in History,
Lewis M u m f o r d favors
the cool or casually structured towns over the hot and intensely
iillcd-in cities. T h e great period of Athens, he feels, was one d u r i n g
w h i c h most of the democratic habits o f village life and participation still obtained. T h e n burst f o r t h the f u l l variety o f human

in business and i n management consists i n allowing the employee
more freedom to discover and define his f u n c t i o n . Likewise, i n
reading a detective story the reader participates as co-author
simply because so m u c h has been l e f t out o f the narrative. T h e
open-mesh silk stocking is far more sensuous than the smooth
n y l o n , just because the eye must act as hand i n filling i n and
completing the image, exactly as i n the mosaic of the T V image.
Douglas Cater i n The Fourth Branch of Government
tells
h o w the men of the W a s h i n g t o n press bureaus delighted t o c o m plete or fill i n the blank o f Calvin Coolidge's personality. Because
he was so like a mere cartoon, they f e l t the urge t o complete his
image f o r h i m and his public. I t is instructive that the press applied
the w o r d " c o o l " to Cal. I n the v e r y sense o f a cool medium, Calv i n Coolidge was so lacking i n any articulation o f data i n his
public image that there was o n l y one w o r d f o r h i m . H e was real
cool. I n the hot 1920s, the hot press m e d i u m f o u n d Cal v e r y
cool and rejoiced i n his lack of image, since i t compelled the
participation o f the press i n filling i n an image o f h i m f o r the
public. B y contrast, F . D . R . was a hot press agent, himself a rival
of the newspaper m e d i u m and one w h o delighted i n scoring off

Paar ran a cool show f o r the cool T V medium, and became a r i v a l
f o r the patrons of the n i g h t spots and their allies i n the gossip
columns. Jack Paar's w a r w i t h the gossip columnists was a w e i r d
example of clash between a hot and cold medium such as had

30/Understanding

occurred w i t h the "scandal o f the rigged T V quiz shows." T h e
r i v a l r y between the hot press and radio media, o n one hand, and
T V o n the other, f o r the h o t ad buck, served t o confuse and t o
overheat the issues i n the affair that pointlessly involved Charles
van D o r e n .
A n Associated Press story f r o m Santa Monica, California,
August 9, 1962, reported h o w
Nearly 100 traffic violators watched a police traffic accident film today to atone for their violations. T w o had to be
treated for nausea and shock. . . .
Viewers were offered a $5.00 reduction i n fines i f they
agreed to see the movie, Signal 30, made by Ohio State police.
I t showed twisted wreckage and mangled bodies and recorded the screams of accident victims.
W h e t h e r the h o t film m e d i u m using hot content w o u l d cool
off the h o t drivers is a m o o t point. B u t i t does concern any
understanding o f media. T h e effect o f h o t media treatment cannot
include m u c h empathy or participation at any time. I n this connection an insurance ad that featured D a d i n an i r o n l u n g surrounded b y a j o y f u l f a m i l y g r o u p d i d more t o strike terror i n t o
the reader than all the w a r n i n g w i s d o m i n the w o r l d . I t is a
question that arises i n connection w i t h capital punishment. Is a
severe penalty the best deterrent t o serious crime? W i t h regard t o
the bomb and the cold w a r , is the threat of massive retaliation
the most effective means t o peace? Is i t n o t evident i n every human
situation that is pushed to a p o i n t o f saturation that some precipitat i o n occurs? W h e n all the available resources and energies have
been played u p i n an organism or i n any structure there is some
k i n d o f reversal of pattern. T h e spectacle of b r u t a l i t y used as
deterrent can brutalize. B r u t a l i t y used i n sports may humanize
under some conditions, at least. B u t w i t h regard t o the bomb and
retaliation as deterrent, i t is obvious that numbness is the result of
any prolonged terror, a fact that was discovered w h e n the f a l l out shelter program was broached. T h e price of eternal vigilance
is indifference.
Nevertheless, i t makes all the difference whether a hot
medium is used i n a hot or a cool culture. T h e hot radio medium

Media

Hot

and

Cold/31

used i n cool or nonliterate cultures has a violent effect, quite unlike
its effect, say i n England or America, where radio is felt as entertainment. A cool or l o w literacy culture cannot accept hot
media like movies or radio as entertainment. T h e y are, at least,
as radically upsetting f o r them as the cool T V medium has proved
to be f o r our high literacy w o r l d .
A n d as f o r the cool w a r and the hot bomb scare, the cultural
strategy that is desperately needed is humor and play. I t is play
that cools off the hot situations of actual life b y m i m i n g them.
Competitive sports between Russia and the W e s t w i l l hardly serve
that purpose o f relaxation. Such sports are inflammatory, i t is
plain. A n d w h a t w e consider entertainment or f u n i n our media
inevitably appears as violent political agitation t o a cool culture.
One w a y t o spot the basic difference between hot and cold
media uses is to compare and contrast a broadcast o f a symphony
performance w i t h a broadcast of a symphony rehearsal. T w o of
the finest shows ever released b y the CBC were o f Glenn Gould's
procedure i n recording piano recitals, and I g o r Stravinsky's rehearsing the T o r o n t o symphony i n some of his new w o r k . A cool
medium like T V , w h e n really used, demands this involvement i n
process. T h e neat t i g h t package is suited t o hot media, like radio
and gramophone. Francis Bacon never tired of contrasting h o t
and cool prose. W r i t i n g i n "methods" or complete packages, he
contrasted w i t h w r i t i n g i n aphorisms, or single observations such
as "Revenge is a k i n d of w i l d justice." T h e passive consumer wants
packages, b u t those, he suggested, w h o are concerned i n pursuing
knowledge and i n seeking causes w i l l resort to aphorisms, just
because they are incomplete and require participation i n depth.
T h e principle that distinguishes hot and cold media is perf e c t l y embodied i n the f o l k w i s d o m : " M e n seldom make passes
at girls w h o wear glasses." Glasses intensify the o u t w a r d - g o i n g
vision, and f i l l i n the feminine image exceedingly, M a r i o n the
Librarian notwithstanding. D a r k glasses, o n the other hand,
create the inscrutable and inaccessible image that invites a great
deal o f participation and completion.
A g a i n , i n a visual and h i g h l y literate culture, w h e n w e meet a

of the name, so that i n self-defense w e add: " H o w do y o u spell
y o u r name?" Whereas, i n an ear culture, the sound of a man's
name is the overwhelming fact, as Joyce k n e w w h e n he said i n
Finnegans Wake, " W h o gave y o u that n u m b ? " F o r the name of
a man is a n u m b i n g b l o w f r o m w h i c h he never recovers.
A n o t h e r vantage p o i n t f r o m w h i c h t o test the difference
between h o t and cold media is the practical joke. T h e hot literary
medium excludes the practical and participant aspect o f the joke
so completely that Constance Rourke, i n her American
Humor,
considers i t as no joke at all. T o literary people, the practical joke
w i t h its total physical involvement is as distasteful as the p u n that
derails us f r o m the smooth and u n i f o r m progress that is t y p o graphic order. Indeed, t o the l i t e r a r y person w h o is quite unaware
of the intensely abstract nature of the typographic medium, i t is
the grosser and participant forms o f art that seem " h o t , " and the
abstract and intensely literary f o r m that seems " c o o l . " " Y o u may
perceive, M a d a m , " said D r . Johnson, w i t h a pugilistic smile, " t h a t I
am w e l l - b r e d t o a degree of needless scrupulosity." A n d D r .
Johnson was r i g h t i n supposing that " w e l l - b r e d " had come to
mean a white-shirted stress o n attire that rivaled the r i g o r of the
printed page. " C o m f o r t " consists i n abandoning a visual arrangement i n favor of one that permits casual participation of the
senses, a state that is excluded w h e n any one sense, b u t especially
the visual sense, is hotted up to the p o i n t of dominant command of
a situation.
O n the other hand, i n experiments i n w h i c h all outer sensat i o n is w i t h d r a w n , the subject begins a furious f i l l - i n or completion
of senses that is sheer hallucination. So the h o t t i n g - u p o f one sense
tends to effect hypnosis, and the cooling of all senses tends to
result i n hallucination.

The Times of London Service, Geneva:
The agreement to establish a direct

The link, known as the hot line,

affords. T h e Russian uses the telephone f o r the sort o f effects w e
associate w i t h the eager conversation o f the lapel-gripper whose

B o t h telephone and teleprinter as amplifications o f the u n conscious cultural bias o f Moscow, o n one hand, and of Washingt o n , o n the other, are invitations t o monstrous misunderstandings.
T h e Russian bugs rooms and spies b y ear, finding this quite natural.
H e is outraged b y our visual spying, however, f i n d i n g this quite

T h e principle that d u r i n g the stages of their development all

W i t h man his knowledge and the process o f obtaining knowledge

W . B. Yeats w r o t e of this reversal, " T h e visible w o r l d is no longer
a reality and the unseen w o r l d is no longer a dream."
Associated w i t h this transformation o f the real w o r l d i n t o
science f i c t i o n is the reversal n o w proceeding apace, b y w h i c h
the Western w o r l d is g o i n g Eastern, even as the East goes W e s t e r n .
Joyce encoded this reciprocal reverse i n his c r y p t i c phrase:
The West shall shake the East awake
W h i l e ye have the night for morn.
T h e title of his Finnegans Wake is a set o f multi-leveled puns o n

eignties have melted away as r a p i d l y as national sovereignties
under conditions o f electric speed. Obsession w i t h the older patterns o f mechanical, one-way expansion f r o m centers t o margins
is no longer relevant to our electric w o r l d . E l e c t r i c i t y does not
centralize, b u t decentralizes. I t is like the difference between a
railway system and an electric g r i d system: the one requires r a i l heads and b i g urban centers. Electric power, equally available i n
the farmhouse and the Executive Suite, permits any place to be a
center, and does n o t require large aggregations. T h i s reverse
pattern appeared quite early i n electrical "labor-saving" devices,
whether a toaster or washing machine o r vacuum cleaner. Instead
of saving w o r k , these devices p e r m i t everybody t o do his o w n
w o r k . W h a t the nineteenth c e n t u r y had delegated t o servants
and housemaids w e n o w do f o r ourselves. T h i s principle applies
in toto i n the electric age. I n politics, i t permits Castro t o exist
as independent nucleus or center. I t w o u l d p e r m i t Quebec t o leave
the Canadian union i n a w a y quite inconceivable under the regime;
o f the railways. T h e railways require a u n i f o r m political and economic space. O n the other hand, airplane and radio p e r m i t the u t most discontinuity and diversity i n spatial organization.
T o d a y the great principle o f classical physics and economics
and political science, namely that o f the divisibility of each process, has reversed itself b y sheer extension into the unified field
t h e o r y ; and automation i n i n d u s t r y replaces the divisibility of
process w i t h the organic interlacing o f all functions i n the c o m plex. T h e electric tape succeeds the assembly line.
I n the new electric A g e o f I n f o r m a t i o n and programmed

I t was Julien Benda's Great Betrayal that helped to c l a r i f y
the n e w situation i n w h i c h the intellectual suddenly holds the
w h i p hand i n society. Benda saw that the artists and intellectuals
w h o had l o n g been alienated f r o m power, and w h o since V o l t a i r e
had been i n opposition, had n o w been drafted f o r service i n the
highest echelons of decision-making. T h e i r great betrayal was that
they had surrendered their autonomy and had become the f l u n kies o f power, as the atomic physicist at the present moment is the
f l u n k y o f the w a r lords.
H a d Benda k n o w n his history, he w o u l d have been less angry
and less surprised. F o r i t has always been the role o f intelligentsia
to act as liaison and as mediators between o l d and new power
groups. M o s t familiar o f such groups is the case of the Greek
slaves, w h o were f o r l o n g the educators and confidential clerks
of the Roman power. A n d i t is precisely this servile role of the
confidential clerk to the tycoon—commercial, m i l i t a r y , or p o l i t i cal—that the educator has continued t o play i n the W e s t e r n
w o r l d u n t i l the present moment. I n England " t h e A n g r i e s " were
a g r o u p of such clerks w h o had suddenly emerged f r o m the
lower echelons b y the educational escape hatch. As they emerged
into the upper w o r l d of power, they f o u n d that the air was n o t at
all fresh or bracing. B u t they lost their nerve even quicker than
Bernard Shaw lost his. L i k e Shaw, they q u i c k l y settled d o w n t o
w h i m s y and to the cultivation of entertainment values.
I n his Study of History, Toynbee notes a great many reversals o f f o r m and dynamic, as w h e n , i n the middle o f the f o u r t h
century A . D . , the Germans i n the Roman service began a b r u p t l y t o

marked new confidence b o r n of saturation w i t h Roman values,
and i t was a moment marked b y the complementary Roman
swing t o w a r d p r i m i t i v e values. ( A s Americans saturate w i t h
European values, especially since T V , t h e y begin t o insist u p o n
American coach lamps, h i t c h i n g posts, and colonial kitchenware
as c u l t u r a l objects.) Just as the barbarians g o t t o the t o p of the

have seemed a natural moment f o r the intellectuals t o have taken
over w h i l e the governing class was t o u r i n g Disneyland, as i t
were. So i t must have appeared to M a r x and his followers. B u t
they reckoned w i t h o u t understanding the dynamics of the new
media o f communication. M a r x based his analysis most u n t i m e l y
on the machine, just as the telegraph and other implosive forms
began t o reverse the mechanical dynamic.
T h e present chapter is concerned w i t h showing that i n any
medium or structure there is w h a t Kenneth B o u l d i n g calls a
"break boundary at w h i c h the system suddenly changes into another o r passes some p o i n t o f no r e t u r n i n its dynamic processes."
Several such "break boundaries" w i l l be discussed later, including
the one f r o m stasis to m o t i o n , and f r o m the mechanical t o the
organic i n the pictorial w o r l d . One effect o f the static photo had
been t o suppress the conspicuous consumption o f the r i c h , b u t the
effect o f the speed-up o f the photo had been t o provide fantasy
riches f o r the poor o f the entire globe.
T o d a y the road beyond its break boundary turns cities into
highways, and the h i g h w a y proper takes on a continuous urban
character. A n o t h e r characteristic reversal after passing a road
break boundary is that the c o u n t r y ceases t o be the center of
all w o r k , and the c i t y ceases t o be the center o f leisure. I n fact,
i m p r o v e d roads and transport have reversed the ancient pattern
and made cities the centers o f w o r k and the c o u n t r y the place o f
leisure and of recreation.
Earlier, the increase of traffic that came w i t h money and
roads had ended the static tribal state (as T o y n b e e calls the
nomadic food-gathering c u l t u r e ) . T y p i c a l o f the reversing that
occurs at break boundaries is the paradox that nomadic mobile
man, the hunter and food-gatherer, is socially static. O n the other
hand, sedentary, specialist man is dynamic, explosive, progressive.

rase of Oedipus Rex, w h o solved the riddle o f the Sphinx. I t was
us if the Greeks f e l t that the penalty f o r one break-through was
a j H iicral sealing-off o f awareness t o the total field. I n a Chinese
woik—The
Way and Its Power ( A . W a l e y translation)—there is
u scries o f instances o f the overheated medium, the overextended
man or culture, and the peripety or reversal that inevitably f o l lows:

I Ic who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm;
I Ie who takes the longest strides does not walk the fastest . . .
I ie who boasts of what he w i l l do succeeds i n nothing;
I ic who is proud of his w o r k achieves nothing that endures.
One o f the most c o m m o n causes o f breaks i n any system is the
cross-fertilization w i t h another system, such as happened t o p r i n t
with the steam press, or w i t h radio and movies ( t h a t yielded the

phonetic literacy, just as the phonetic alphabet had been the
break boundary between tribal and individualist man.
T h e endless reversals or break boundaries passed i n the i n t e r play o f the structures o f bureaucracy and enterprise include the
point at w h i c h individuals began t o be held responsible and accountable f o r their "private actions." T h a t was the moment o f

i n love w i t h a n y t h i n g he regarded as himself. Obviously he w o u l d
have had v e r y different feelings about the image had he k n o w n
i t was an extension or repetition o f himself. I t is, perhaps, indicative o f the bias o f our intensely technological and, therefore,
narcotic culture that w e have l o n g interpreted the Narcissus story
t o mean that he f e l l i n love w i t h himself, that he imagined the
reflection t o be Narcissus!
Physiologically there are abundant reasons f o r an extension
o f ourselves i n v o l v i n g us i n a state of numbness. Medical researchers like Hans Selye and A d o l p h e Jonas h o l d that all extensions of
ourselves, i n sickness or i n health, are attempts t o maintain equil i b r i u m . A n y extension o f ourselves they regard as "autoamputatdon," and t h e y f i n d that the autoamputative p o w e r or strategy
is resorted t o b y the b o d y w h e n the perceptual p o w e r cannot
locate o r avoid the cause o f i r r i t a t i o n . O u r language has m a n y
expressions that indicate this self-amputation that is imposed b y
various pressures. W e speak o f " w a n t i n g to j u m p o u t of m y s k i n "
or o f " g o i n g o u t of m y m i n d , " being " d r i v e n b a t t y " or " f l i p p i n g
m y l i d . " A n d w e often create artificial situations that rival the
irritations and stresses o f real l i f e under controlled conditions o f
sport and play.
W h i l e i t was no part o f the intention o f Jonas and Selye t o
provide an explanation of human invention and technology, t h e y
have given us a t h e o r y o f disease ( d i s c o m f o r t ) that goes far t o
explain w h y man is impelled t o extend various parts o f his b o d y
b y a k i n d o f autoamputation. I n the physical stress o f superstimu¬
lation o f various kinds, the central nervous system acts t o protect
itself b y a strategy o f amputation or isolation o f the offending
organ, sense, or f u n c t i o n . T h u s , the stimulus t o n e w invention
is the stress of acceleration o f pace and increase o f load. For
example, i n the case o f the wheel as an extension o f the f o o t , the
pressure o f new burdens resulting f r o m the acceleration of exchange b y w r i t t e n and monetary media was the immediate occasion o f the extension or " a m p u t a t i o n " of this f u n c t i o n f r o m our
bodies. T h e wheel as a counter-irritant t o increased burdens, i n
t u r n , brings about a new intensity of action b y its amplification
o f a separate or isolated f u n c t i o n (the feet i n r o t a t i o n ) . Such

jimplification is bearable b y the nervous system o n l y t h r o u g h n u m b ness or b l o c k i n g o f perception. T h i s is the sense o f the Narcissus
m y t h . T h e y o u n g man's image is a self-amputation or extension
induced b y i r r i t a t i n g pressures. As counter-irritant, the image
produces a generalized numbness or shock that declines recognition. Self-amputation forbids self-recognition.
T h e principle o f self-amputation as an immediate relief of
strain on the central nervous system applies v e r y readily t o the
origin o f the media o f communication f r o m speech t o computer.
Physiologically, the central nervous system, that electric netw o r k that coordinates the various media o f our senses, plays the
c hief role. Whatever threatens its f u n c t i o n must be contained,
localized, or cut off, even t o the total removal of the offending
organ. T h e f u n c t i o n o f the b o d y , as a g r o u p of sustaining and
protective organs f o r the central nervous system, is t o act as
buffers against sudden variations o f stimulus i n the physical and
social environment. Sudden social failure or shame is a shock that
some may "take t o heart" or that may cause muscular disturbance
in general, signaling f o r the person t o w i t h d r a w f r o m the threatening situation.
T h e r a p y , whether physical or social, is a coimter-irritant that
aids i n that equilibrium o f the physical organs w h i c h protect the
central nervous system. Whereas pleasure is a counter-irritant
(e.g., sports, entertainment, and alcohol), c o m f o r t is the removal
of irritants. B o t h pleasure and c o m f o r t are strategies o f equilibr i u m f o r the central nervous system.
W i t h the arrival o f electric technology, man extended, o r
set outside himself, a live model of the central nervous system i t self. T o the degree that this is so, i t is a development that suggests
a desperate and suicidal autoamputation, as i f the central nervous
system c o u l d no longer depend o n the physical organs t o be
protective buffers against the slings and arrows of outrageous
mechanism. I t c o u l d w e l l be that the successive mechanizations o f
the various physical organs since the invention of p r i n t i n g have
made too violent and superstimulated a social experience f o r the
central nervous system t o endure.

ment, w e can r e t u r n t o the Narcissus theme. F o r i f Narcissus is
numbed b y his self-amputated image, there is a v e r y good reason
f o r the numbness. T h e r e is a close parallel of response between
the patterns o f physical and psychic trauma or shock. A person
suddenly deprived of loved ones and a person w h o drops a f e w
feet unexpectedly w i l l b o t h register shock. B o t h the loss o f f a m i l y
and a physical fall are extreme instances o f amputations of the
self. Shock induces a generalized numbness or an increased threshold t o all types o f perception. T h e v i c t i m seems immune to pain
or sense.
Battle shock created b y violent noise has been adapted f o r
dental use i n the device k n o w n as audiac. T h e patient puts o n
headphones and turns a dial raising the noise level t o the point
that he feels no pain f r o m the d r i l l . T h e selection o f a single sense
f o r intense stimulus, or o f a single extended, isolated, o r " a m putated" sense i n technology, is i n part the reason f o r the n u m b i n g
effect that technology as such has on its makers and users. For
the central nervous system rallies a response of general numbness
to the challenge o f specialized i r r i t a t i o n .
T h e person w h o falls suddenly experiences i m m u n i t y to all
pain or sensory stimuli because the central nervous system has t o
be protected f r o m any intense thrust o f sensation. O n l y gradually
does he regain normal sensitivity t o sights and sounds, at w h i c h
time he m a y begin t o tremble and perspire and t o react as he
w o u l d have done i f the central nervous system had been prepared
i n advance f o r the fall that occurred unexpectedly.
Depending o n w h i c h sense or f a c u l t y is extended technologically, or "autoamputated," the "closure" or equilibrium-seeking
among the other senses is f a i r l y predictable. I t is w i t h the senses
as i t is w i t h color. Sensation is always 100 per cent, and a color is
always 100 per cent color. B u t the ratio among the components i n
the sensation or the color can differ infinitely. Y e t i f sound, f o r
example, is intensified, t o u c h and taste and sight are affected at
once. T h e effect o f radio o n literate or visual man was to reawaken
his tribal memories, and the effect o f sound added t o m o t i o n pictures was t o diminish the role o f mime, t a c t i l i t y , and kinesthesis.
Similarly, w h e n nomadic man turned t o sedentary and specialist

The

ways, the senses specialized too. T h e development of w r i t i n g
and the visual organization o f life made possible the discovery o f
individualism, introspection and so on.
A n y invention or technology is an extension or self-amputalion of our physical bodies, and such extension also demands new
tatios or new equilibriums among the other organs and extensions o f the b o d y . T h e r e is, f o r example, no w a y o f refusing
t < > c o m p l y w i t h the new sense ratios or sense "closure" evoked b y
the T V image. B u t the effect o f the e n t r y o f the T V image w i l l
vary f r o m culture t o culture i n accordance w i t h the existing
sense ratios i n each culture. I n audile-tactile Europe T V has i n tensified the visual sense, spurring them t o w a r d A m e r i c a n styles
of packaging and dressing, i n America, the intensely visual culture,
T V has opened the doors o f audile-tactile perception t o the n o n visual w o r l d o f spoken languages and f o o d and the plastic arts.
As an extension and expediter of the sense life, any m e d i u m at
once affects the entire field o f the senses, as the Psalmist explained
long ago i n the 115th Psalm:
Their idols are silver and gold,
The w o r k of men's hands.
They have mouths, but they speak not;
Eyes they have, but they see not;
They have ears, but they hear not;
Noses have they, but they smell not;
They have hands, but they handle not;
Feet have they, but they walk not;
Neither speak they through their throat.
They that make them shall be like unto them;
Yea, every one that trusteth i n them.
T h e concept o f " i d o l " f o r the H e b r e w Psalmist is m u c h like
that o f Narcissus f o r the Greek m y t h m a k e r . A n d the Psalmist
insists that the beholding o f idols, or the use o f technology, conforms men to them. " T h e y that make t h e m shall be l i k e u n t o
them." T h i s is a simple fact o f sense "closure." T h e poet Blake
developed the Psalmist's ideas i n t o an entire t h e o r y o f c o m m u nication and social change, I t is i n his l o n g poem o f Jerusalem
that he explains w h y men have become w h a t they have beheld.

W h a t t h e y have, says Blake, is " t h e spectre o f the Reasoning
Power i n M a n " that has become fragmented and "separated f r o m
Imagination and enclosing itself as i n steel." Blake, i n a w o r d , sees
man as fragmented b y his technologies. B u t he insists that these
technologies are self-amputations o f our o w n organs. W h e n so
amputated, each organ becomes a closed system o f great new i n tensity that hurls m a n i n t o " m a r t y r d o m s and w a r s . " Moreover,
Blake announces as his theme i n Jerusalem the organs o f perception:
I f Perceptive Organs vary, Objects of Perception seem to
vary:
I f Perceptive Organs close, their Objects seem t o close also.
T o behold, use o r perceive any extension o f ourselves i n
technological f o r m is necessarily t o embrace i t . T o listen t o radio
o r t o read the printed page is t o accept these extensions o f ourselves i n t o our personal system and t o undergo the "closure" or
displacement o f perception that f o l l o w s automatically. I t is this
continuous embrace o f our o w n technology i n daily use that puts
us i n the Narcissus role o f subliminal awareness and numbness i n
relation t o these images o f ourselves. B y continuously embracing
technologies, w e relate ourselves t o them as servomechanisms.
T h a t is w h y w e must, t o use t h e m at all, serve these objects, these
extensions o f ourselves, as gods o r m i n o r religions. A n Indian is
the servo-mechanism o f his canoe, as the c o w b o y o f his horse
or the executive o f his clock.
Physiologically, man i n the normal use o f technology ( o r
his variously extended b o d y ) is perpetually modified b y i t and
i n t u r n finds ever n e w ways o f m o d i f y i n g his technology. M a n becomes, as i t were, the sex organs o f the machine w o r l d , as the

W a r and the fear o f w a r have always been considered the main
incentives t o technological extension o f our bodies. Indeed, Lewis
M u m f o r d , i n his The City in History, considers the walled c i t y
itself an extension o f o u r skins, as m u c h as housing and clothing.
M o r e even than the preparation f o r w a r , the aftermath o f i n vasion is a r i c h technological p e r i o d ; because the subject culture
lias t o adjust all its sense ratios t o accommodate the impact o f the
invading culture. I t is f r o m such intensive h y b r i d exchange and
strife o f ideas and forms that the greatest social energies are
released, and f r o m w h i c h arise the greatest technologies. Buckminster Fuller estimates that since 1910 the governments o f the
w o r l d have spent 3 y t r i l l i o n dollars o n airplanes. T h a t is 62 times
the existing gold supply o f the w o r l d .

T h e principle o f numbness comes i n t o play w i t h electric
technology, as w i t h any other. W e have t o n u m b our central
nervous system w h e n i t is extended and exposed, or w e w i l l die.
T hus the age o f anxiety and of electric media is also the age o f
the unconscious and o f apathy. B u t i t is s t r i k i n g l y the age o f
consciousness o f the unconscious, i n addition. W i t h our central
nervous system strategically numbed, the tasks o f conscious awareness and order are transferred t o the physical life of man, so that
for the first time he has become aware o f technology as an extension o f his physical b o d y . A p p a r e n t l y this could not have
happened before the electric age gave us the means o f instant,
total field-awareness. W i t h such awareness, the subliminal life,
private and social, has been hoicked u p i n t o f u l l v i e w , w i t h the
result that w e have "social consciousness" presented t o us as a

turned t o the m e d i u m o f language itself as shaping the arrangements o f daily life, so that society begins t o l o o k like a linguistic
echo or repeat o f language norms, a fact that has disturbed the
Russian Communist p a r t y v e r y deeply. W e d d e d as they are t o

T h a t is o n l y the East side story, f o r the electric implosion

energies that develop b y electric fusion or implosion w h e n literate
individuals are suddenly gripped b y an electromagnetic field,
such as occurs i n the new C o m m o n M a r k e t pressure i n Europe?
M a k e no mistake, the fusion of people w h o have k n o w n i n d i v i d ualism and nationalism is not the same process as the fission of "backw a r d " and oral cultures that are just coming t o individualism and
nationalism. I t is the difference between the " A " bomb and the " H "
bomb. T h e latter is more violent, b y far. Moreover, the products of
electric fusion are immensely complex, w h i l e the products o f
fission are simple. Literacy creates v e r y m u c h simpler kinds of
people than those that develop i n the complex w e b o f o r d i n a r y
tribal and oral societies. For the fragmented man creates the
homogenized W e s t e r n w o r l d , w h i l e oral societies are made up of
people differentiated, n o t b y their specialist skills o r visible marks,

is a tangle o f complex emotions and feelings that the W e s t e r n

Western individualism are even n o w assuming the appearance,

dare to c o n f r o n t such facts at the conscious level, or is i t best t o
becloud and repress such matters u n t i l some violence releases

explosion and independence f o r tribal man. I t may be merely
t emperament i n m y o w n case, b u t I f i n d some easing o f the burden
in just understanding and c l a r i f y i n g the issues. O n the other hand,
since consciousness and awareness seem t o be a human privilege,
may i t not be desirable to extend this c o n d i t i o n to our hidden
conflicts, b o t h private and social?
T h e present book, i n seeking to understand many media, the
conflicts f r o m w h i c h t h e y spring, and the even greater conflicts
to w h i c h they give rise, holds out the promise o f reducing these
conflicts b y an increase o f human autonomy. L e t us n o w note

T h e electric light ended the regime of n i g h t and day, o f

all night, and w i n d o w s can be l e f t out of buildings. I n a w o r d , the

I t is a peculiar bias o f those w h o operate media f o r the

more about the media as such, and are not inclined t o go beyond

W h a t I am saying is that media as extensions o f our senses
institute new ratios, n o t o n l y among our private senses, b u t among
ihcmsclves, w h e n they interact among themselves. Radio changed

b e y o n d that and t o transfer the entire show t o the m e m o r y o f a

biological creatures, possesses an apparatus o f transmission and
transformation based o n his power t o store experience. A n d his
p o w e r t o store, as i n a language itself, is also a means o f transform a t i o n o f experience:
"Those pearls that were his eyes."

O r w e m i g h t r e t u r n t o the state o f tribal man, f o r w h o m

just as a metaphor transforms and transmits experience, so do the

" Y o u r invitation is n o t just one of those casual gestures that I
must brush off. I t makes me feel all the frustration o f an interr u p t e d ball game that I can't get w i t h i t . " As i n all metaphors,

As Tzu-Gung was traveling through the regions north of
the river Han, he saw an old man working i n his vegetable
garden. He had dug an irrigation ditch. The man would
descend into a well, fetch up a vessel of water i n his arms
and pour i t out into the ditch. W h i l e his efforts were tremendous the results appeared to be very meager.
Tzu-Gung said, "There is a way whereby you can irrigate
a hundred ditches i n one day, and whereby you can do
much w i t h little effort. W o u l d you not like to hear of it?"
Then the gardener stood up, looked at him and said, " A n d
what would that be?"
Tsu-Gung replied, " Y o u take a wooden lever, weighted at
the back and light i n front. I n this way you can bring up
water so quickly that i t just gushes out. This is called a drawwell."
Then anger rose up i n the old man's face, and he said,
" I have heard m y teacher say that whoever uses machines
does all his w o r k like a machine. H e who does his w o r k like
a machine grows a heart like a machine, and he who carries
the heart of a machine i n his breast loses his simplicity. H e
who has lost his simplicity becomes unsure i n the strivings of
his soul. Uncertainty i n the strivings of the soul is something
which does not agree w i t h honest sense. I t is not that I do

I t is this aspect o f neiv art that Kenneth Galbraith recommends t o the careful study o f businessmen w h o w a n t t o stay i n

t a l k i n g about the artist's being ahead of his time. O u r technology
is, also, ahead o f its time, i f w e reckon b y the ability t o recognize
i t f o r w h a t i t is. T o prevent undue wreckage i n society, the artist
tends n o w t o move f r o m the i v o r y t o w e r t o the c o n t r o l t o w e r o f
society. Just as higher education is no longer a f r i l l or l u x u r y b u t
a stark need of p r o d u c t i o n and operational design i n the electric
age, so the artist is indispensable i n the shaping and analysis and
understanding o f the l i f e o f forms, and structures created b y
electric technology.
T h e percussed victims o f the new technology have invariably
muttered clichés about the impracticality o f artists and their
f a n c i f u l preferences. B u t i n the past c e n t u r y i t has come t o be
generally acknowledged that, i n the w o r d s o f W y n d h a m Lewis,
" T h e artist is always engaged i n w r i t i n g a detailed history o f the

t o counter or neutralize collective pressures and irritations. B u t
the counter-irritant usually proves a greater plague than the
initial i r r i t a n t , like a d r u g habit. A n d i t is here that the artist can

or just i n time t o become a motorcar disaster. F o r an arrangement

T h e somewhat devious means o f diagnosis that have to be
used t o p i n d o w n the actual f o r m and impact o f a new m e d i u m
are n o t unlike those indicated i n detective fiction b y Peter
Cheyney. I n You Can't Keep the Change (Collins, L o n d o n , 1956)
he w r o t e :
A case to Callaghan was merely a collection of people,
some of whom,—all of whom—were giving incorrect information, or telling lies, because circumstances either forced
them or led them into the process.
But the fact that they had to tell lies; had to give false i m pressions, necessitated a reorientation of their o w n viewpoints
and their own lives. Sooner or later they became exhausted or
careless. Then, and not until then, was an investigator able to
put his finger on the one fact that would lead him to a possible logical solution.
I t is interesting t o note that success i n keeping u p a respectable f r o n t o f customary k i n d can o n l y be done b y a frantic scramble back o f the façade. A f t e r the crime, after the b l o w has fallen,
the façade o f custom can o n l y be held u p b y s w i f t rearrangement
of the props. So i t is i n our social lives w h e n a new technology
strikes, or i n our private life w h e n some intense and, therefore,
indigestible experience occurs, and the censor acts at once t o n u m b
us f r o m the b l o w and t o ready the faculties to assimilate the
intruder. Peter Cheyney's observations o f a mode of detective
fiction is another instance of a popular f o r m of entertainment
f u n c t i o n i n g as m i m i c model o f the real t h i n g .
Perhaps the most obvious "closure" or psychic consequence
of any new technology is just the demand f o r i t . N o b o d y wants

T V u n t i l there are T V programs. T h i s p o w e r of technology t o

create its o w n w o r l d o f demand is n o t independent o f technologybeing first an extension of our o w n bodies and senses. W h e n w e
are deprived o f our sense of sight, the other senses take up the
role of sight i n some degree. B u t the need t o use the senses that
are available is as insistent as breathing—a fact that makes sense
o f the urge to keep radio and T V going more or less c o n t i n uously. T h e urge t o continuous use is quite independent of the
" c o n t e n t " of public programs or o f the private sense life, being
testimony t o the fact that technology is part o f our bodies.
Electric technology is d i r e c t l y related t o our central nervous
systems, so i t is ridiculous to talk o f " w h a t the public wants"
played over its o w n nerves. T h i s question w o u l d be like asking
people w h a t sort o f sights and sounds they w o u l d prefer around
them i n an urban metropolis! Once w e have surrendered our
senses and nervous systems t o the private manipulation of those
w h o w o u l d t r y to benefit f r o m t a k i n g a lease o n our eyes and ears
and nerves, w e don't really have any rights left. Leasing our eyes
and ears and nerves to commercial interests is like handing over
the c o m m o n speech to a private corporation, or like g i v i n g the
earth's atmosphere t o a company as a m o n o p o l y . Something like
this has already happened w i t h outer space, f o r the same reasons
that w e have leased our central nervous systems t o various corporations. As l o n g as w e adopt the Narcissus attitude o f regarding
the extensions o f our o w n bodies as really out there and really
independent o f us, w e w i l l meet all technological challenges w i t h
the same sort o f banana-skin pirouette and collapse.
Archimedes once said, " G i v e me a place t o stand and I w i l l

T h e y specialize and become indispensable t o their masters. I t
is p r o b a b l y the l o n g human history o f enslavement, and the
collapse into specialism as a counter-irritant, that have p u t the
stigma o f servitude and pusillanimity o n the figure of the specialist,
even i n modern times. T h e capitulation o f W e s t e r n man t o his
technology, w i t h its crescendo o f specialized demands, has always
appeared to many observers of our w o r l d as a k i n d o f enslavement.
B u t the resulting fragmentation has been v o l u n t a r y and enthusiastic, unlike the conscious strategy o f specialism o n the part o f the
captives o f m i l i t a r y conquest.
I t is plain that fragmentation or specialism as a technique o f
achieving security under t y r a n n y and oppression of any k i n d
has an attendant danger. Perfect adaptation t o any environment
is achieved b y a total channeling o f energies and vital force that
amounts t o a k i n d o f static terminus f o r a creature. Even slight
changes i n the environment o f the v e r y w e l l adjusted find them
w i t h o u t any resource t o meet new challenge. Such is the plight
o f the representatives o f "conventional w i s d o m " i n any society.
T h e i r entire stake o f security and status is i n a single f o r m o f
acquired knowledge, so that innovation is f o r them n o t n o v e l t y
b u t annihilation.
A related f o r m o f challenge that has always faced cultures
is the simple fact o f a f r o n t i e r or a w a l l , o n the other side o f
w h i c h exists another k i n d o f society. Mere existence side b y side

Such, indeed, has been the principle o f symbolist artistic structures

civilization set side b y side w i t h a tribal society has over and over
demonstrated that the simpler society finds its integral economy
and institutions "disintegrated b y a rain o f psychic energy generated b y the cvilization" o f the more complex culture. W h e n t w o

o g y o f a time is p o w e r f u l l y thrusting i n one direction, w i s d o m
may w e l l call f o r a countervailing thrust. T h e implosion of electric
energy i n our century cannot be met b y explosion or expansion,
b u t i t can be met b y decentralism and the flexibility o f multiple
small centers. For example, the rush of students into our universities is n o t explosion b u t implosion. A n d the needful strategy t o
encounter this force is n o t t o enlarge the university, b u t t o create

vague description, not analysis of causality at all. Militarism is a
k i n d of visual organization of social energies that is b o t h specialist
and explosive, so that i t is merely repetitive to say, as Toynbee
does, that i t b o t h creates large empires and causes social breakd o w n . B u t militarism is a f o r m o f industrialism or the concentration of large amounts of homogenized energies into a f e w kinds
of p r o d u c t i o n . T h e Roman soldier was a man w i t h a spade. H e
was an expert w o r k m a n and builder w h o processed and packaged
the resources o f many societies and sent them home. Before
machinery, the o n l y massive w o r k forces available f o r processing
material were soldiers or slaves. A s the Greek m y t h o f Cadmus
points out, the phonetic alphabet was the greatest processer of men
f o r homogenized m i l i t a r y life that was k n o w n to antiquity. T h e
age of Greek society that Herodotus acknowledges t o have been
"overwhelmed b y more troubles than i n the t w e n t y preceding
generations" was the time that t o our literary retrospect appears
as one of the greatest of human centuries. I t was Macaulay w h o
remarked that i t was n o t pleasant to live i n times about w h i c h i t
was exciting to read. T h e succeeding age of Alexander saw H e l lenism expand i n t o Asia and prepare the course of the later Roman
expansion. These, however, were the v e r y centuries i n w h i c h
Greek civilization obviously fell apart.
Toynbee points to the strange falsification o f history b y
archeology, insofar as the survival o f many material objects of the
past does n o t indicate the quality o f ordinary life and experience
at any particular time. Continuous technical improvement i n the
means o f warfare occurs over the entire period of Hellenic and
Roman decline. T o y n b e e checks o u t his hypothesis b y testing i t
w i t h the developments i n Greek agriculture. W h e n the enterprise o f Solon weaned the Greeks f r o m mixed f a r m i n g t o a
program o f specialized products f o r export, there were happy consequences and a glorious manifestation o f energy i n Greek life.
W h e n the next phase of the same specialist stress involved m u c h

ses dramatically, t h o u g h h i g h l y literate people tend t o speak as
connectedly and casually as possible. T h e sensuous involvement
natural to cultures i n w h i c h literacy is n o t the r u l i n g f o r m of
experience is sometimes indicated i n travel guides, as i n this item
f r o m a guide to Greece:
You w i l l notice that many Greek men seem to spend a lot
of time counting the beads of what appear to be amber
rosaries. But these have no religious significance. They are
komboloia or " w o r r y beads," a legacy f r o m the Turks, and
Greeks click them on land, on the sea, i n the air to ward off
that insupportable silence which threatens to reign whenever
conversation lags. Shepherds do i t , cops do i t , stevedores and
merchants in their shops do i t . A n d i f you wonder w h y so
few Greek women wear beads, you'll know it's because their
husbands have pre-empted them for the simple pleasure of
clicking. More aesthetic than thumb-twiddling, less expensive
than smoking, this Queeg-like obsession indicates a tactile
sensuousness characteristic of a race which has produced the
western world's greatest sculpture . . .
W h e r e the heavy visual stress of literacy is lacking i n a
culture, there occurs another f o r m o f sensuous involvement and
cultural appreciation that our Greek guide explains whimsically:
. . . do not be surprised at the frequency w i t h which you are
patted, petted and prodded in Greece. You may end up feeling like the family dog . . . in an affectionate family. This
propensity to pat seems to us a tactile extension of the avid
Greek curiosity noted before. It's as though your hosts are
trying to find out what you are made of.
T h e w i d e l y separate characters of the spoken and w r i t t e n
w o r d s are easy t o study today w h e n there is ever closer t o u c h
w i t h nonliterate societies. One native, the o n l y literate member
o f his group, t o l d o f acting as reader f o r the others w h e n they
received letters. H e said he felt impelled to p u t his fingers to his
ears w h i l e reading aloud, so as n o t t o violate the p r i v a c y o f their
letters. T h i s is interesting testimony t o the values of privacy
fostered b y the visual stress of phonetic w r i t i n g . Such separation
o f the senses, and o f the individual f r o m the group, can scarcely
occur w i t h o u t the influence o f phonetic w r i t i n g . T h e spoken

w o r d does n o t afford the extension and amplification o f the visual
p o w e r needed f o r habits o f individualism and privacy.
I t helps t o appreciate the nature o f the spoken w o r d t o
contrast i t w i t h the w r i t t e n f o r m . A l t h o u g h phonetic w r i t i n g
separates and extends the visual p o w e r o f words, i t is comparat i v e l y crude and slow. T h e r e are n o t m a n y ways o f w r i t i n g
" t o n i g h t , " b u t Stanislavsky used t o ask his y o u n g actors t o p r o nounce and stress i t f i f t y different ways w h i l e the audience w r o t e
d o w n the different shades o f feeling and meaning expressed. M a n y
a page o f prose and m a n y a narrative has been devoted t o expressi n g w h a t was, i n effect, a sob, a moan, a laugh, or a piercing
scream. T h e w r i t t e n w o r d spells o u t i n sequence w h a t is quick and
i m p l i c i t i n the spoken w o r d .
A g a i n , i n speech w e tend t o react t o each situation that
occurs, reacting i n tone and gesture even t o our o w n act of speaki n g . B u t w r i t i n g tends t o be a k i n d o f separate or specialist action
i n w h i c h there is little o p p o r t u n i t y or call f o r reaction. T h e literate
man or society develops the tremendous p o w e r o f acting i n any
matter w i t h considerable detachment f r o m the feelings or emotional involvement that a nonliterate man or society w o u l d experience.
H e n r i Bergson, the French philosopher, lived and w r o t e i n a
t r a d i t i o n o f t h o u g h t i n w h i c h i t was and is considered that
language is a human technology that has impaired and diminished
the values o f the collective unconscious. I t is the extension of man
i n speech that enables the intellect t o detach itself f r o m the vastly
w i d e r reality. W i t h o u t language, Bergson suggests, human i n telligence w o u l d have remained totally involved i n the objects o f
its attention. Language does f o r intelligence w h a t the wheel does
f o r the feet and the b o d y . I t enables t h e m t o move f r o m t h i n g t o
t h i n g w i t h greater ease and speed and ever less involvement.
Language extends and amplifies man b u t i t also divides his faculties. H i s collective consciousness or i n t u i t i v e awareness is d i m i n ished b y this technical extension of consciousness that is speech.
Bergson argues i n Creative Evolution
that even consciousness is an extension o f man that dims the bliss o f u n i o n i n the
collective unconscious. Speech acts t o separate man f r o m man,

and m a n k i n d f r o m the cosmic unconscious. As an extension or
u t t e r i n g ( o u t e r i n g ) o f all our senses at once, language has always
been held t o be man's richest art f o r m , that w h i c h distinguishes
h i m f r o m the animal creation.
I f the human ear can be compared t o a radio receiver that
is able to decode electromagnetic waves and recode them as sound,
the human voice may be compared to the radio transmitter i n
being able to translate sound i n t o electromagnetic waves. T h e
power of the voice to shape air and space into verbal patterns
may w e l l have been preceded b y a less specialized expression of
cries, grunts, gestures, and commands, o f song and dance. T h e
patterns of the senses that are extended i n the various languages
o f men are as varied as styles o f dress and art. Each mother
tongue teaches its users a w a y o f seeing and feeling the w o r l d ,
and of acting i n the w o r l d , that is quite unique.
O u r new electric technology that extends our senses and
nerves i n a global embrace has large implications f o r the f u t u r e
of language. Electric technology does n o t need w o r d s any more
than the digital computer needs numbers. E l e c t r i c i t y points the
w a y to an extension of the process o f consciousness itself, on a
w o r l d scale, and w i t h o u t any verbalization whatever. Such a state
o f collective awareness may have been the preverbal condition
o f men. Language as the technology o f human extension, whose
powers o f division and separation w e k n o w so w e l l , m a y have
been the " T o w e r of Babel" b y w h i c h men sought t o scale the
highest heavens. T o d a y computers h o l d o u t the promise o f a means
of instant translation of any code or language i n t o any other
code or language. T h e computer, i n short, promises b y technology
a Pentecostal c o n d i t i o n of universal understanding and u n i t y .
T h e next logical step w o u l d seem to be, n o t t o translate, b u t t o
by-pass languages i n favor o f a general cosmic consciousness
w h i c h m i g h t be v e r y like the collective unconscious dreamt of b y
Bergson. T h e c o n d i t i o n of "weightlessness," that biologists say
promises a physical i m m o r t a l i t y , m a y be paralleled b y the cond i t i o n of speechlessness that c o u l d confer a perpetuity o f collective harmony and peace.

The one crowded space i n Father
Perry's house was his bookshelves. I
gradually came to understand that the
marks on the pages were trapped
words. Anyone could learn to decipher
the symbols and turn the trapped words
loose again into speech. The ink of the
print trapped the thoughts; they could
no more get away than a doomboo
could get out of a pit. W h e n the f u l l

subject. I t is t r u e that there is more material w r i t t e n and printed
and read today than ever before, b u t there is also a n e w electric
technology that threatens this ancient technology of literacy
b u i l t on the phonetic alphabet. Because o f its action i n extending
our central nervous system, electric technology seems t o favor
the inclusive and participational spoken w o r d over the specialist
w r i t t e n w o r d . O u r Western values, b u i l t o n the w r i t t e n w o r d ,
have already been considerably affected b y the electric media of
telephone, radio, and T V . Perhaps that is the reason w h y many
h i g h l y literate people i n our time find i t difficult t o examine this
question w i t h o u t getting into a m o r a l panic. T h e r e is the f u r t h e r
circumstance that, d u r i n g his more than t w o thousand years of
literacy, W e s t e r n man has done little to study or t o understand
the effects o f the phonetic alphabet i n creating many o f his basic
patterns of culture. T o begin n o w t o examine the question may,
therefore, seem too late.
Suppose that, instead o f displaying the Stars and Stripes, w e
were t o w r i t e the w o r d s " A m e r i c a n flag" across a piece o f c l o t h
and to display that. W h i l e the symbols w o u l d convey the same
meaning, the effect w o u l d be quite different. T o translate the r i c h
visual mosaic o f the Stars and Stripes into w r i t t e n f o r m w o u l d be
t o deprive i t o f most o f its qualities o f corporate image and o f
experience, y e t the abstract literal b o n d w o u l d remain m u c h the
same. Perhaps this illustration w i l l serve t o suggest the change
the tribal man experiences w h e n he becomes literate. N e a r l y all
the emotional and corporate f a m i l y feeling is eliminated f r o m
his relationship w i t h his social g r o u p . H e is emotionally free t o
separate f r o m the tribe and t o become a civilized individual, a
man of visual organization w h o has u n i f o r m attitudes, habits, and
rights w i t h all other civilized individuals.
T h e Greek m y t h about the alphabet was that Cadmus, reputedly the k i n g w h o introduced the phonetic letters i n t o Greece,
sowed the dragon's teeth, and t h e y sprang u p armed men. L i k e any
other m y t h , this one capsulates a prolonged process i n t o a flashing
insight. T h e alphabet meant p o w e r and a u t h o r i t y and c o n t r o l o f
m i l i t a r y structures at a distance. W h e n combined w i t h papyrus,
the alphabet spelled the end o f the stationary temple bureauc-

racies and the priestly monopolies of knowledge and p o w e r .
U n l i k e pre-alphabetic w r i t i n g , w h i c h w i t h its innumerable signs
was difficult t o master, the alphabet c o u l d be learned i n a f e w
hours. T h e acquisition o f so extensive a knowledge and so complex
a skill as pre-alphabetic w r i t i n g represented, w h e n applied to such
u n w i e l d y materials as b r i c k and stone, insured f o r the scribal
caste a m o n o p o l y of priestly power. T h e easier alphabet and the
l i g h t , cheap, transportable papyrus together effected the transfer
o f p o w e r f r o m the priestly t o the m i l i t a r y class. A l l this is implied
i n the m y t h about Cadmus and the dragon's teeth, including the
fall o f the c i t y states, the rise o f empires and m i l i t a r y bureaucracies.
I n terms o f the extensions o f man, the theme of the dragon's
teeth i n the Cadmus m y t h is o f the utmost importance. Elias
Canetti i n Crowds and Power reminds us that the teeth are an
obvious agent of p o w e r i n man, and especially i n many animals.
Languages are filled w i t h testimony t o the grasping, devouring
p o w e r and precision o f teeth. T h a t the p o w e r o f letters as agents
o f aggressive order and precision should be expressed as extensions
o f the dragon's teeth is natural and f i t t i n g . T e e t h are emphatically
visual i n their lineal order. Letters are n o t o n l y like teeth visually,
b u t their power t o p u t teeth i n t o the business o f empire-building
is manifest i n our W e s t e r n history.
T h e phonetic alphabet is a unique technology. T h e r e have
been m a n y kinds o f w r i t i n g , pictographic and syllabic, b u t there
is o n l y one phonetic alphabet i n w h i c h semantically meaningless
letters are used to correspond to semantically meaningless sounds.
T h i s stark divison and parallelism between a visual and an auditory
w o r l d was b o t h crude and ruthless, c u l t u r a l l y speaking. T h e
phonetically w r i t t e n w o r d sacrifices w o r l d s o f meaning and perception that were secured b y forms like the hieroglyph and the
Chinese ideogram. These c u l t u r a l l y richer forms o f w r i t i n g , h o w ever, offered men no means of sudden transfer f r o m the magically
discontinuous and traditional w o r l d o f the t r i b a l w o r d i n t o the
cool and u n i f o r m visual medium. M a n y centuries o f ideogrammic
use have n o t threatened the seamless w e b o f f a m i l y and t r i b a l
subtleties o f Chinese society. O n the other hand, a single genera-

84/'Understanding

t i o n o f alphabetic literacy suffices i n A f r i c a today, as i n G a u l t w o
thousand years ago, t o release the individual initially, at least,
f r o m the tribal w e b . T h i s fact has n o t h i n g t o do w i t h the content
of the alphabetized w o r d s ; i t is the result o f the sudden breach
between the a u d i t o r y and the visual experience of man. O n l y the
phonetic alphabet makes such a sharp division i n experience, giving
to its user an eye f o r an ear, and freeing h i m f r o m the t r i b a l trance
of resonating w o r d magic and the w e b o f kinship.
I t can be argued, then, that the phonetic alphabet, alone, is
the technology that has been the means o f creating " c i v i l i z e d
man"—the separate individuals equal before a w r i t t e n code o f
law. Separateness of the individual, c o n t i n u i t y of space and o f
time, and u n i f o r m i t y o f codes are the prime marks of literate and
civilized societies. T r i b a l cultures like those o f the I n d i a n and the
Chinese may be greatly superior t o the Western cultures, i n the
range and delicacy o f their perceptions and expression. H o w e v e r ,
w e are not here concerned w i t h the question of values, b u t w i t h
the configurations of societies. T r i b a l cultures cannot entertain
the possibility o f the individual or o f the separate citizen. T h e i r
ideas o f spaces and times are neither continuous n o r u n i f o r m , b u t
compassional and compressional i n their intensity. I t is i n its
p o w e r t o extend patterns of visual u n i f o r m i t y and c o n t i n u i t y
that the "message" of the alphabet is f e l t b y cultures.
As an intensification and extension o f the visual f u n c t i o n , the
phonetic alphabet diminishes the role o f the other senses o f sound
and t o u c h and taste i n any literate culture. T h e fact that this does
n o t happen i n cultures such as the Chinese, w h i c h use nonphonetic
scripts, enables them t o retain a r i c h store o f inclusive perception
i n depth of experience that tends t o become eroded i n civilized c u l tures of the phonetic alphabet. F o r the ideogram is an inclusive
gestalt, n o t an analytic dissociation o f senses and functions like
phonetic w r i t i n g .
T h e achievements of the W e s t e r n w o r l d , i t is obvious, are test i m o n y to the tremendous values o f literacy. B u t m a n y people are
also disposed t o object that w e have purchased our structure o f

lineal structuring o f rational life b y phonetic literacy has involved
us i n an interlocking set o f consistencies that are striking enough
t o j u s t i f y a m u c h more extensive i n q u i r y than that o f the present
chapter. Perhaps there are better approaches along quite d i f ferent lines; f o r example, consciousness is regarded as the mark o f
a rational being, y e t there is nothing lineal or sequential about the
total field of awareness that exists i n any moment of consciousness.
Consciousness is n o t a verbal process. Yet d u r i n g all our centuries
o f phonetic literacy w e have favored the chain of inference as the
m a r k o f logic and reason. Chinese w r i t i n g , i n contrast, invests each
ideogram w i t h a total i n t u i t i o n of being and reason that allows
o n l y a small role to visual sequence as a m a r k o f mental effort and
organization. I n W e s t e r n literate society i t is still plausible and
acceptable to say that something " f o l l o w s " f r o m something, as
i f there were some cause at w o r k that makes such a sequence.
I t was D a v i d H u m e w h o , i n the eighteenth century, demonstrated
that there is no causality indicated i n any sequence, natural or
logical. T h e sequential is merely additive, n o t causative. Hume's
argument, said Immanuel K a n t , "awoke me f r o m m y dogmatic
slumber." Neither H u m e nor Kant, however, detected the hidden
cause o f our Western bias t o w a r d sequence as " l o g i c " i n the a l l pervasive technology o f the alphabet. T o d a y i n the electric age
w e feel as free to invent nonlineal logics as w e do to make n o n Euclidean geometries. Even the assembly line, as the method o f
analytic sequence f o r mechanizing every k i n d of making and
p r o d u c t i o n , is nowadays y i e l d i n g to new forms.
O n l y alphabetic cultures have ever mastered connected lineal
sequences as pervasive forms o f psychic and social organization.
T h e breaking up o f every k i n d of experience i n t o u n i f o r m units
i n order t o produce faster action and change of f o r m (applied
knowledge) has been the secret o f Western p o w e r over man and
nature alike. T h a t is the reason w h y our W e s t e r n industrial
programs have quite i n v o l u n t a r i l y been so militant, and o u r
m i l i t a r y programs have been so industrial. B o t h are shaped b y the

manifest even i n the Graeco-Roman phase, became more intense
w i t h the u n i f o r m i t y and repeatability o f the Gutenberg development.
Civilization is b u i l t on literacy because literacy is a u n i f o r m
processing o f a culture b y a visual sense extended i n space and time
b y the alphabet. I n tribal cultures, experience is arranged b y a
dominant a u d i t o r y sense-life that represses visual values. T h e
auditory sense, unlike the cool and neutral eye, is hyper-esthetic
and delicate and all-inclusive. O r a l cultures act and react at the
same time. Phonetic culture endows men w i t h the means of repressing their feelings and emotions w h e n engaged i n action. T o
act w i t h o u t reacting, w i t h o u t involvement, is the peculiar advantage o f Western literate man.
T h e story o f The Ugly American describes the endless succession o f blunders achieved b y visual and civilized Americans
w h e n confronted w i t h the tribal and a u d i t o r y cultures of the East.
A s a civilized U N E S C O experiment, r u n n i n g w a t e r — w i t h its lineal
organization of pipes—was installed recently i n some Indian v i l lages. Soon the villagers requested that the pipes be removed, f o r
i t seemed t o them that the w h o l e social life o f the village had been
impoverished w h e n i t was no longer necessary f o r all t o visit the
communal w e l l . T o us the pipe is a convenience. W e do n o t t h i n k
o f i t as culture or as a p r o d u c t o f literacy, any more than w e t h i n k
of literacy as changing our habits, our emotions, or our perceptions. T o nonliterate people, i t is perfectly obvious that the most
commonplace conveniences represent total changes i n culture.
T h e Russians, less permeated w i t h the patterns o f literate c u l ture than Americans, have m u c h less difficulty i n perceiving and
accommodating the Asiatic attitudes. For the W e s t , literacy has
l o n g been pipes and taps and streets and assembly lines and inventories. Perhaps most potent o f all as an expression o f literacy is
our system of u n i f o r m p r i c i n g that penetrates distant markets
and speeds the turn-over o f commodities. Even our ideas of cause
and effect i n the literate W e s t have l o n g been i n the f o r m o f things
i n sequence and succession, an idea that strikes any tribal or audit o r y culture as quite ridiculous, and one that has lost its prime
place i n our o w n n e w physics and b i o l o g y .

A l l the alphabets i n use i n the W e s t e r n w o r l d , f r o m that o f
Russia t o that of the Basques, f r o m that o f Portugal t o that o f
Peru, are derivatives o f the Graeco-Roman letters. T h e i r unique
separation o f sight and sound f r o m semantic and verbal content
made them a most radical technology f o r the translation and
homogenization o f cultures. A l l other forms o f w r i t i n g had served
merely one culture, and had served t o separate that culture f r o m
others. T h e phonetic letters alone could be used t o translate, albeit
crudely, the sounds o f any language i n t o one-and-the-same visual
code. T o d a y , the e f f o r t o f the Chinese t o use our phonetic letters
t o translate their language has r u n i n t o special problems i n the
w i d e tonal variations and meanings o f similar sounds. T h i s has
led t o the practice o f fragmenting Chinese monosyllables i n t o
polysyllables i n order t o eliminate tonal a m b i g u i t y . T h e W e s t e r n
phonetic alphabet is n o w at w o r k transforming the central a u d i t o r y
features o f the Chinese language and culture i n order that China
can also develop the lineal and visual patterns that give central
u n i t y and aggregate u n i f o r m power t o W e s t e r n w o r k and organization. A s w e move o u t o f the Gutenberg era o f our o w n culture,
w e can more readily discern its p r i m a r y features of homogeneity,
u n i f o r m i t y , and c o n t i n u i t y . These were the characteristics that
gave the Greeks and Romans their easy ascendancy over the
nonliterate barbarians. T h e barbarian or t r i b a l man, then as n o w ,
was hampered b y cultural pluralism, uniqueness, and discontinuity.
T o sum u p , pictographic and hieroglyphic w r i t i n g as used
i n Babylonian, M a y a n , and Chinese cultures represents an extension o f the visual sense f o r storing and expediting access t o human
experience. A l l o f these forms give pictorial expression t o oral
meanings. As such, they approximate the animated cartoon and are
extremely u n w i e l d y , r e q u i r i n g many signs f o r the i n f i n i t y of data
and operations o f social action. I n contrast, the phonetic alphabet,
b y a f e w letters o n l y , was able t o encompass all languages. Such
an achievement, however, involved the separation o f b o t h signs
and sounds f r o m their semantic and dramatic meanings. N o other
system o f w r i t i n g had accomplished this feat.
T h e same separation o f sight and sound and meaning that is
peculiar t o the phonetic alphabet also extends to its social and

psychological effects. Literate man undergoes m u c h separation of
his imaginative, emotional, and sense life, as Rousseau (and later
the Romantic poets and philosophers) proclaimed l o n g ago.
T o d a y the mere mention of D . H . Lawrence w i l l serve t o recall
the t w e n t i e t h - c e n t u r y efforts made t o by-pass literate man i n
order t o recover human "wholeness." I f W e s t e r n literate man
undergoes m u c h dissociation of inner sensibility f r o m his use of
the alphabet, he also wins his personal freedom t o dissociate
himself f r o m clan and f a m i l y . T h i s freedom t o shape an individual
career manifested itself i n the ancient w o r l d i n m i l i t a r y life. Careers were open t o talents i n Republican Rome, as m u c h as i n
Napoleonic France, and f o r the same reasons. T h e new literacy
had created an homogeneous and malleable milieu i n w h i c h the

was as novel as i t was practical.

concerned w i t h all forms o f transport o f goods and i n f o r m a t i o n ,
b o t h as metaphor and exchange. Each f o r m o f transport n o t onlycarries, b u t translates and transforms, the sender, the receiver,
and the message. T h e use o f any k i n d o f medium or extension o f
man alters the patterns o f interdependence among people, as i t
alters the ratios among our senses.
I t is a persistent theme o f this b o o k that all technologies are
extensions o f o u r physical and nervous systems t o increase power
and speed. A g a i n , unless there w e r e such increases o f p o w e r and
speed, new extensions o f ourselves w o u l d n o t occur or w o u l d be
discarded. F o r an increase o f p o w e r or speed i n any k i n d o f
g r o u p i n g o f any components whatever is itself a disruption
that causes a change o f organization. T h e alteration o f social
groupings, and the f o r m a t i o n o f n e w communities, occur w i t h
the increased speed o f i n f o r m a t i o n movement b y means o f
paper messages and road transport. Such speed-up means m u c h
more c o n t r o l at m u c h greater distances. H i s t o r i c a l l y , i t meant
the f o r m a t i o n o f the Roman E m p i r e and the disruption of the
previous city-states o f the Greek w o r l d . Before the use o f papyrus
and alphabet created the incentives f o r b u i l d i n g fast, hard-surface
roads, the walled t o w n and the city-state were natural forms that
could endure.
Village and city-state essentially are forms that include all
human needs and functions. W i t h greater speed and, therefore,
greater m i l i t a r y c o n t r o l at a distance, the city-state collapsed.
Once inclusive and self-contained, its needs and functions were
extended i n the specialist activities o f an empire. Speed-up tends
t o separate functions, b o t h commercial and political, and accelerat i o n b e y o n d a p o i n t i n any system becomes disruption and breakd o w n . So w h e n A r n o l d T o y n b e e turns, i n A Study of
History,

he begins b y saying: " O n e o f the most conspicuous marks o f
disintegration, as w e have already noticed, is . . . w h e n a disintegrating civilisation purchases a reprieve b y submitting t o

and reprieve, alike, are the consequence o f ever faster movement

Speed-up creates w h a t some economists refer t o as a centermargin structure. W h e n this becomes too extensive f o r the generating and c o n t r o l center, pieces begin t o detach themselves
and t o set up new center-margin systems of their o w n . T h e most
familiar example is the story o f the A m e r i c a n colonies o f Great
Britain. W h e n the thirteen colonies began t o develop a c o n siderable social and economic life o f their o w n , they felt the
need t o become centers themselves, w i t h their o w n margins. T h i s
is the time w h e n the original center m a y make a more rigorous
e f f o r t o f centralized c o n t r o l o f the margins, as, indeed, Great
B r i t a i n d i d . T h e slowness of sea travel p r o v e d altogether inadequate t o the maintenance o f so extensive an empire o n a mere
center-margin basis. L a n d powers can more easily attain a unified
center-margin pattern than sea powers. I t is the relative slowness
o f sea travel that inspires sea powers t o foster multiple centers
b y a k i n d o f seeding process. Sea powers thus tend t o create centers w i t h o u t margins, and land empires favor the center-margin
structure. Electric speeds create centers everywhere. Margins
cease t o exist on this planet.
L a c k o f homogeneity i n speed o f i n f o r m a t i o n movement creates diversity o f patterns i n organization. I t is quite predictable,
then, that any n e w means o f m o v i n g i n f o r m a t i o n w i l l alter any
p o w e r structure whatever. So l o n g as the new means is everywhere available at the same time, there is a possibility that the
structure may be changed w i t h o u t b r e a k d o w n . W h e r e there are
great discrepancies i n speeds o f movement, as between air and
road travel or between telephone and t y p e w r i t e r , serious c o n flicts occur w i t h i n organizations. T h e metropolis o f our time has
become a test case f o r such discrepancies. I f homogeneity o f
speeds were total, there w o u l d be no rebellion and no breakdown.
W i t h p r i n t , political u n i t y via homogeneity became feasible f o r
the first time. I n ancient Rome, however, there was o n l y the
l i g h t paper manuscript t o pierce the opacity, or t o reduce the
discontinuity, o f the t r i b a l villages; and w h e n the paper supplies
failed, the roads were vacated, as they were i n our o w n age d u r i n g
gas-rationing. T h u s the o l d city-state returned, and feudalism
replaced republicanism.

I t seems obvious enough that technical means o f speed-up
should w i p e o u t the independence o f villages and city-states.
Whenever speed-up has occurred, the n e w centralist p o w e r always
takes action to homogenize as m a n y marginal areas as possible.
T h e process that Rome effected b y the phonetic alphabet geared
t o its paper routes has been o c c u r r i n g i n Russia f o r the last cent u r y . A g a i n , f r o m the current example o f A f r i c a w e can observe
h o w v e r y m u c h visual processing o f the human psyche b y
alphabetic means w i l l be needed before any appreciable degree
o f homogenized social organization is possible. M u c h of this
visual processing was done i n the ancient w o r l d b y nonliterate
technologies, as i n Assyria. T h e phonetic alphabet has no r i v a l ,
however, as a translator o f man out o f the closed t r i b a l echochamber i n t o the neutral visual w o r l d of lineal organization.
T h e situation o f A f r i c a t o d a y is complicated b y the n e w
electronic technology. W e s t e r n man is himself being de-Westernized b y his o w n n e w speed-up, as m u c h as the Africans are being
detribalized b y our o l d p r i n t and industrial technology. I f w e
understood our o w n media o l d and new, these confusions and disruptions could be programmed and synchronized. T h e v e r y success w e enjoy i n specializing and separating functions i n order t o
have speed-up, however, is at the same time the cause o f inattent i o n and unawareness o f the situation. I t has ever been thus i n the
W e s t e r n w o r l d at least. Self-consciousness o f the causes and limits
o f one's o w n culture seems t o threaten the ego structure and is,
therefore, avoided. Nietzsche said understanding stops action, and
men o f action seem t o have an i n t u i t i o n o f the fact i n their shunn i n g the dangers o f comprehension.
T h e p o i n t o f the matter o f speed-up b y wheel, road, and
paper is the extension o f power i n an ever more homogeneous and
u n i f o r m space. T h u s the real potential o f the Roman technology
was n o t realized u n t i l p r i n t i n g had given road and wheel a
m u c h greater speed than that o f the Roman vortex. Y e t the
speed-up o f the electronic age is as disrupting f o r literate, lineal,
and W e s t e r n man as the Roman paper routes were f o r tribal
villagers. O u r speed-up today is n o t a slow explosion o u t w a r d

o f space and functions. O u r specialist and fragmented civilization
o f center-margin structure is suddenly experiencing an instantaneous reassembling o f all its mechanized bits into an organic
w h o l e . T h i s is the n e w w o r l d o f the global village. T h e village,
as M u m f o r d explains i n The City in History, had achieved a social
and institutional extension o f all human faculties. Speed-up and
c i t y aggregates o n l y served t o separate these f r o m one another
i n more specialist forms. T h e electronic age cannot sustain the
v e r y l o w gear o f a center-margin structure such as w e associate
w i t h the past t w o thousand years o f the W e s t e r n w o r l d . N o r
is this a question o f values. I f w e understood our older media,
such as roads and the w r i t t e n w o r d , and i f w e valued their human
effects sufficiently, w e c o u l d reduce or even eliminate the elect r o n i c factor f r o m our lives. Is there an instance o f any culture
that understood the technology that sustained its structure and
was prepared t o keep i t that way? I f so, that w o u l d be an instance
o f values or reasoned preference. T h e values or preferences that
arise f r o m the mere automatic operation o f this or that technology
i n our social lives are n o t capable o f being perpetuated.
I n the chapter o n the wheel i t w i l l be shown that transport
w i t h o u t wheels had played a b i g role before the wheel, some o f
w h i c h was b y sledge, over b o t h snow and bogs. M u c h o f i t was
b y pack animal—woman being the first pack animal. M o s t w h e e l less transport i n the past, however, was b y river and b y sea, a fact
that is today as r i c h l y expressed as ever i n the location and f o r m o f
the great cities of the w o r l d . Some writers have observed that
man's oldest beast o f burden was w o m a n , because the male had
to be free t o r u n interference f o r the w o m a n , as ball-carrier, as i t
were. B u t that phase belonged to the prewheel stage o f transport,
w h e n there was o n l y the tractless waste o f man the hunter and
food-gatherer. T o d a y , w h e n the greatest volume o f transport
consists i n the m o v i n g o f i n f o r m a t i o n , the wheel and the road
are undergoing recession and obsolescence; b u t i n the first i n stance, given the pressure f o r , and f r o m , wheels, there had t o be
roads t o accommodate them. Settlements had created the impulse
f o r exchange and f o r the increasing movement o f r a w material

was division o f labor and specialist c r a f t skills. Improvement of
wheel and road more and more b r o u g h t the t o w n t o the c o u n t r y
i n a reciprocal spongelike action o f give-and-take. I t is a process
w e have seen i n this century w i t h the motorcar. Great improvements i n roads b r o u g h t the c i t y more and more t o the c o u n t r y .
T h e road became a substitute f o r the c o u n t r y b y the time people
began t o talk about " t a k i n g a spin i n the c o u n t r y . " W i t h superhighways the road became a w a l l between man and the c o u n t r y .
T h e n came the stage of the h i g h w a y as c i t y , a c i t y stretching
continuously across the continent, dissolving all earlier cities into
the sprawling aggregates that desolate their populations today.
W i t h air transport comes a f u r t h e r disruption o f the o l d t o w n c o u n t r y complex that had occurred w i t h wheel and road. W i t h
the plane the cities began to have the same slender relation to
human needs that museums do. T h e y became corridors o f showcases echoing the departing forms o f industrial assembly lines. T h e
road is, then, used less and less f o r travel, and more and more f o r
recreation. T h e traveler n o w turns t o the airways, and thereby
ceases to experience the act o f traveling. As people used to say
that an ocean liner m i g h t as w e l l be a hotel i n a b i g c i t y , the
jet traveler, whether he is over T o k y o or N e w Y o r k , m i g h t just
as w e l l be i n a cocktail lounge so far as travel experience is concerned. H e w i l l begin to travel o n l y after he lands.
Meantime, the countryside, as oriented and fashioned b y
plane, b y h i g h w a y , and b y electric information-gathering, tends
t o become once more the nomadic trackless area that preceded
the wheel. T h e beatniks gather o n the sands to meditate haiku.
T h e principal factors i n media impact o n existing social
forms are acceleration and disruption. T o d a y the acceleration
tends to be total, and thus ends space as the main factor i n social
arrangements. T o y n b e e sees the acceleration factor as translating
the physical i n t o moral problems, p o i n t i n g to the antique road
c r o w d e d w i t h dog carts, wagons, and rickshaws as f u l l o f m i n o r
nuisance, b u t also m i n o r dangers. Further, as the forces impelling
traffic m o u n t i n power, there is no more problem o f hauling and
c a r r y i n g , b u t the physical problem is translated i n t o a psychological one as the annihilation o f space permits easy annihilation

o f travelers as w e l l . T h i s principle applies t o all media study. A l l
means o f interchange and o f human interassociation tend t o i m prove b y acceleration. Speed, i n t u r n , accentuates problems o f
f o r m and structure. T h e older arrangements had n o t been made
w i t h a v i e w to such speeds, and people begin t o sense a drainingaway o f life values as they t r y t o make the o l d physical forms
adjust t o the new and speedier movement. These problems,
however, are n o t new. Julius Caesar's first act u p o n assuming
p o w e r was to restrict the n i g h t movement o f wheeled vehicles
i n the c i t y of Rome i n order t o p e r m i t sleep. I m p r o v e d transport
i n the Renaissance t u r n e d the medieval walled towns i n t o slums.
Prior to the considerable diffusion o f p o w e r t h r o u g h alphabet and papyrus, even the attempts o f kings t o extend their r u l e
i n spatial terms were opposed at home b y the priestly bureaucracies. T h e i r complex and u n w i e l d y media o f stone inscription
made wide-ranging empires appear v e r y dangerous t o such static
monopolies. T h e struggles between those w h o exercised p o w e r
over the hearts o f men and those w h o sought t o c o n t r o l the p h y s i cal resources o f nations were n o t o f one time and place. I n the
O l d Testament, just this k i n d o f struggle is reported i n the Book o f
Samuel ( I , v i i i ) w h e n the children o f Israel besought Samuel t o
give them a k i n g . Samuel explained t o t h e m the nature o f k i n g l y ,
as opposed to priestly, rule:
This w i l l be the manner of the K i n g that shall reign over
you: he w i l l take your sons, and appoint them unto him f o r
his chariots; and they shall run before his chariots: and he
w i l l appoint them unto him f o r captains of thousands, and
captains of fifties; and he w i l l set some to plough his ground,
and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war,
and the instruments of his chariots. A n d he w i l l take your
daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks and to be
bakers. A n d he w i l l take your fields, and your vineyards, and
your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his
servants.
Paradoxically, the effect of the wheel and o f paper i n o r ganizing new p o w e r structures was n o t t o decentralize b u t t o
centralize. A speed-up i n communications always enables a

central a u t h o r i t y t o extend its operations t o more distant margins.
T h e i n t r o d u c t i o n o f alphabet and papyrus meant that m a n y more
people had t o be trained as scribes and administrators. H o w e v e r ,
the resulting extension o f homogenization and of u n i f o r m t r a i n i n g
d i d n o t come i n t o play i n the ancient or medieval w o r l d t o any
great degree. I t was n o t really u n t i l the mechanization o f w r i t i n g
i n the Renaissance that intensely unified and centralized p o w e r
was possible. Since this process is still o c c u r r i n g , i t should be easy
f o r us t o see that i t was i n the armies o f E g y p t and Rome that a
k i n d o f democratization b y u n i f o r m technological education
occurred. Careers were then open t o talents f o r those w i t h literate
training. I n the chapter o n the w r i t t e n w o r d w e saw h o w p h o netic w r i t i n g translated tribal man i n t o a visual w o r l d and i n v i t e d
h i m t o undertake the visual organization o f space. T h e priestly
groups i n the temples had been more concerned w i t h the records
o f the past and w i t h the c o n t r o l o f the inner space o f the unseen
than w i t h o u t w a r d m i l i t a r y conquest. Hence, there was a clash
between the priestly monopolizers o f knowledge and those w h o
wished t o apply i t abroad as new conquest and power. ( T h i s same
clash n o w recurs between the university and the business w o r l d . )
I t was this k i n d o f r i v a l r y that inspired Ptolemy I I to establish the
great l i b r a r y at Alexandria as a center o f imperial p o w e r . T h e
huge staff o f c i v i l servants and scribes assigned t o m a n y specialist
tasks was an antithetic and countervailing force t o the E g y p t i a n
priesthood. T h e l i b r a r y could serve the political organization of
empire i n a w a y that d i d not interest the priesthood at all. A
not-dissimilar r i v a l r y is developing today between the atomic
scientists and those w h o are m a i n l y concerned w i t h p o w e r .
I f w e realize that the c i t y as center was i n the first instance
an aggregate o f threatened villagers, i t is then easier f o r us t o
grasp h o w such harassed companies o f refugees m i g h t f a n o u t
i n t o an empire. T h e city-state as a f o r m was n o t a response t o
peaceful commercial development, b u t a huddling f o r security
amidst anarchy and dissolution. T h u s the Greek city-state was a
t r i b a l f o r m of inclusive and integral c o m m u n i t y , quite unlike
the specialist cities that g r e w u p as extensions of R o m a n m i l i t a r y

expansion. T h e Greek city-states eventually disintegrated b y the
usual action of specialist t r a d i n g and the separation of functions
that M u m f o r d portrays i n The City in History. T h e Roman cities
began that way—as specialist operations o f the central power. T h e
Greek cities ended that w a y .
I f a c i t y undertakes r u r a l trade, i t sets u p at once a centerm a r g i n relation w i t h the r u r a l area i n question. T h a t relation
involves taking staples and r a w produce f r o m the c o u n t r y i n
exchange f o r specialist products o f the craftsman. I f , on the other
hand, the same c i t y attempts t o engage i n overseas trade, i t is more
natural to "seed" another c i t y center, as the Greeks d i d , rather
than t o deal w i t h the overseas area as a specialized margin or r a w
material supply.
A brief review o f the structural changes i n the organization
o f space as they resulted f r o m wheel, road, and papyrus could go
as f o l l o w s : T h e r e was first the village, w h i c h lacked all of these
g r o u p extensions o f the private physical b o d y . T h e village, h o w ever, was already a f o r m o f c o m m u n i t y different f r o m that o f
food-gathering hunters and fishers, f o r villagers may be sedent a r y and m a y begin a division of labor and functions. T h e i r being
congregated is, itself, a f o r m o f acceleration o f human activities
w h i c h provides m o m e n t u m f o r f u r t h e r separation and specializat i o n o f action. Such are the conditions f o r the extension of feetas-wheel t o speed p r o d u c t i o n and exchange. These are, also, the
conditions that intensify communal conflicts and ruptures that
send men huddling i n t o ever larger aggregates, i n order t o resist the accelerated activities o f other communities. T h e villages
are swept u p i n t o the city-state b y w a y o f resistance and f o r the
purpose o f security and protection.
T h e village had institutionalized all human functions i n forms
o f l o w intensity. I n this m i l d f o r m everyone could play many roles.
Participation was h i g h , and organization was l o w . T h i s is the f o r mula f o r stability i n any t y p e o f organization. Nevertheless, the
enlargement of village forms i n the city-state called f o r greater
intensity and the inevitable separation o f functions to cope w i t h
this intensity and competition. T h e villagers had all participated

98/Understanding

i n the seasonal rituals that i n the c i t y became the specialized
Greek drama. M u m f o r d feels that " T h e village measure prevailed
i n the development o f the Greek cities, d o w n t o the f o u r t h cent u r y . . . " (The City in History).
I t is this extension and translat i o n o f the human organs i n t o the village model w i t h o u t loss of
corporal u n i t y that M u m f o r d uses as a criterion of excellence f o r
c i t y forms i n any time or locale. T h i s biological approach to the
man-made environment is sought today once more i n the electric
age. H o w strange that the idea o f the " h u m a n scale" should have
seemed quite w i t h o u t appeal d u r i n g the mechanical centuries.
T h e natural tendency o f the enlarged c o m m u n i t y of the
c i t y is t o increase the intensity and accelerate functions o f every
sort, whether o f speech, or crafts, o r currency and exchange.
T h i s , i n t u r n , implies an inevitable extension o f these actions b y
subdivision or, w h a t is the same t h i n g , new invention. So that even
t h o u g h the c i t y was f o r m e d as a k i n d o f protective hide or shield
f o r man, this protective layer was purchased at the cost o f maximized struggle w i t h i n the walls. W a r games such as those described b y Herodotus began as r i t u a l blood baths between the c i t i zenry. Rostrum, l a w courts, and marketplace all acquired the i n tense image of divisive competition that is nowadays called "the
rat race." Nevertheless, i t was amidst such irritations that man
produced his greatest inventions as counter-irritants. These i n ventions were extensions o f himself b y means o f concentrated
t o i l , b y w h i c h he hoped to neutralize distress. T h e Greek w o r d
ponos or " t o i l , " was a t e r m used b y Hippocrates, the father o f
medicine, t o describe the f i g h t o f the b o d y i n disease. T o d a y this
idea is called homeostasis, or equilibrium as a strategy o f the stayi n g p o w e r o f any b o d y . A l l organizations, b u t especially biological
ones, struggle t o remain constant i n their inner c o n d i t i o n amidst
the variations o f outer shock and change. T h e man-made social
environment as an extension o f man's physical b o d y is no except i o n . T h e c i t y , as a f o r m o f the b o d y politic, responds t o new
pressures and irritations b y resourceful new extensions—always

T h e Roman a r m y as a mobile, industrial wealth-making
force created i n addition a vast consumer public i n the Roman

producer and consumer, even as i t tends t o separate the place o f

W i t h the c u t t i n g - o f f of the supplies o f papyrus b y the M o hammedans, the Mediterranean, l o n g a Roman lake, became a
M u s l i m lake, and the Roman center collapsed. W h a t had been

Papyrus never returned. Byzantium, like the medieval centers,

W i t h the m o v i n g of i n f o r m a t i o n i n p r i n t e d f o r m , the wheel

therefore, that greatly increased wheel speeds, b o t h o n road

done a similar job of speed-up and specialization i n the ancient

N o w that man has extended his central nervous system b y
electric technology, the field o f battle has shifted t o mental imagemaking-and-breaking, b o t h i n w a r and i n business. U n t i l the
electric age, higher education had been a privilege and a l u x u r y
f o r the leisured classes; today i t has become a necessity f o r p r o duction and survival. N o w , w h e n i n f o r m a t i o n itself is the main
traffic, the need f o r advanced knowledge presses o n the spirits o f
the most routine-ridden minds. So sudden an upsurge of academic
t r a i n i n g i n t o the marketplace has i n i t the quality of classical
peripety or reversal, and the result has been a w i l d g u f f a w f r o m
the gallery and the campus. T h e hilarity, however, w i l l die d o w n
as the Executive Suites are taken over b y the Ph.D.s.
F o r an insight i n t o the ways i n w h i c h the acceleration o f
wheel and road and paper rescramble population and settlement
patterns, let us glance at some instances provided b y Oscar
H a n d l i n i n his study Boston's Immigrants. I n 1790, he tells us,
Boston was a compact u n i t w i t h all workers and traders l i v i n g i n
sight o f each other, so that there was no tendency to section residential areas on a class basis: " B u t as the t o w n grew, as the o u t l y i n g districts became more accessible, the people spread out and
at the same time were localized i n distinctive areas." T h a t one
sentence capsulates the theme o f this chapter. T h e sentence can be
generalized t o include the art of w r i t i n g : " A s knowledge was
spread o u t visually and as i t became more accessible i n alphabetic
f o r m , i t was localized and divided i n t o specialties." U p t o the
p o i n t just short of electrification, increase o f speed produces d i v i sion o f f u n c t i o n , and o f social classes, and of knowledge.
A t electric speed, however, all that is reversed. Implosion and
contraction then replace mechanical explosion and expansion.
I f the H a n d l i n f o r m u l a is extended t o p o w e r , i t becomes: " A s
p o w e r g r e w , and as o u t l y i n g areas became accessible t o power, i t
was localized i n distinctive delegated jobs and functions." T h i s
f o r m u l a is a principle o f acceleration at all levels of human o r ganization. I t concerns especially those extensions of our physical
bodies that appear i n wheel and road and paper messages. N o w

that w e have extended n o t just our physical organs b u t the nervous
system, itself, i n electric technology, the principle o f specialism
and division as a factor o f speed no longer applies. W h e n i n f o r m a t i o n moves at the speed o f signals i n the central nervous system,
man is confronted w i t h the obsolescence o f all earlier forms of acceleration, such as road and rail. W h a t emerges is a total field of
inclusive awareness. T h e o l d patterns o f psychic and social adjustment become irrelevant.
U n t i l the 1820s, H a n d l i n tells us, Bostonians w a l k e d to and
f r o , or used private conveyances. H o r s e - d r a w n buses were i n t r o duced i n 1826, and these speeded u p and extended business a great
deal. Meantime the speed-up o f i n d u s t r y i n England had extended
business i n t o the r u r a l areas, dislodging many f r o m the land and
increasing the rate o f i m m i g r a t i o n . Sea transport o f immigrants
became lucrative and encouraged a great speed-up o f ocean transp o r t . T h e n the Cunard L i n e was subsidized b y the British government i n order t o ensure s w i f t contact w i t h the colonies. T h e
railways soon l i n k e d into this Cunard service, t o convey mail
and immigrants inland.
A l t h o u g h A m e r i c a developed a massive service o f inland
canals and river steamboats, t h e y were n o t geared t o the speeding
wheels of the n e w industrial p r o d u c t i o n . T h e railroad was needed
t o cope w i t h mechanized p r o d u c t i o n , as m u c h as t o span the great
distances o f the continent. T h e steam railroad as an accelerator
proved t o be one o f the most revolutionary of all extensions o f
our physical bodies, creating a n e w political centralism and a new
k i n d of urban shape and size. I t is t o the railroad that the
American c i t y owes its abstract g r i d layout, and the nonorganic
separation o f p r o d u c t i o n , consumption, and residence. I t is the
motorcar that scrambled the abstract shape o f the industrial t o w n ,
m i x i n g up its separated functions t o a degree that has frustrated
and baffled b o t h planner and citizen. I t remained f o r the airplane
to complete the confusion b y a m p l i f y i n g the m o b i l i t y of the
citizen to the p o i n t where urban space as such was irrelevant.
M e t r o p o l i t a n space is equally irrelevant f o r the telephone, the
telegraph, the radio, and television. W h a t the t o w n planners call
"the human scale" i n discussing ideal urban spaces is equally

I n the theater, at a ball, at a ball game, i n church, every i n dividual enjoys all those others present. T h e pleasure o f being
among the masses is the sense of the j o y i n the multiplication of
numbers, w h i c h has l o n g been suspect among the literate members
o f W e s t e r n society.
I n such society, the separation o f the individual f r o m the
g r o u p i n space ( p r i v a c y ) , and i n t h o u g h t ( " p o i n t of v i e w " ) , and
i n w o r k (specialism), has had the cultural and technological supp o r t o f literacy, and its attendant galaxy o f fragmented industrial
and political institutions. B u t the p o w e r of the printed w o r d t o
create the homogenized social man g r e w steadily u n t i l our time,
creating the paradox o f the "mass m i n d " and the mass militarism
o f citizen armies. Pushed t o the mechanized extreme, letters have
o f t e n seemed t o produce effects opposite t o civilization, just
as n u m b e r i n g i n earlier times seemed t o break tribal u n i t y , as the
O l d Testament declares ( " A n d Satan rose u p against Israel, and
moved D a v i d to number Israel"). Phonetic letters and numbers
were the first means of fragmenting and detribalizing man.
T h r o u g h o u t W e s t e r n history w e have traditionally and
r i g h t l y regarded letters as the source of civilization, and looked t o
our literatures as the hallmark of civilized attainment. Y e t all
along, there has been w i t h us a shadow o f number, the language
o f science. I n isolation, number is as mysterious as w r i t i n g . Seen
as an extension of our physical bodies, i t becomes quite intelligible.
Just as w r i t i n g is an extension and separation of our most neutral
and objective sense, the sense o f sight, number is an extension and
separation of our most intimate and interrelating activity, our
sense o f touch.
T h i s f a c u l t y of t o u c h , called the " h a p t i c " sense b y the Greeks,
was popularized as such b y the Bauhaus p r o g r a m of sensuous
education, t h r o u g h the w o r k o f Paul Klee, W a l t e r Gropius, and
m a n y others i n the G e r m a n y o f the 1920s. T h e sense of t o u c h ,
as o f f e r i n g a k i n d of nervous system or organic u n i t y i n the w o r k
of art, has obsessed the minds of the artists since the time o f
Cézanne. F o r more than a century n o w artists have t r i e d t o meet
the challenge of the electric age b y investing the tactile sense
w i t h the role o f a nervous system f o r u n i f y i n g all the others.

Paradoxically, this has been achieved b y "abstract a r t , " w h i c h
offers a central nervous system f o r a w o r k o f art, rather than
the conventional husk o f the o l d pictorial image. M o r e and more
i t has occurred t o people that the sense o f t o u c h is necessary t o
integral existence. T h e weightless occupant o f the space capsule
has t o f i g h t to retain the integrating sense o f t o u c h . O u r mechanical technologies f o r extending and separating the functions
of our physical beings have b r o u g h t us near to a state of disintegration b y p u t t i n g us out o f t o u c h w i t h ourselves. I t may
v e r y w e l l be that i n our conscious inner lives the interplay
among our senses is w h a t constitutes the sense o f t o u c h . Perhaps
touch is n o t just skin contact w i t h things, b u t the v e r y life of
things i n the mind? T h e Greeks had the n o t i o n of a consensus or
a f a c u l t y o f " c o m m o n sense" that translated each sense i n t o each
other sense, and conferred consciousness o n man. T o d a y , w h e n
w e have extended all parts o f our bodies and senses b y technolo g y , w e are haunted b y the need f o r an outer consensus of techn o l o g y and experience that w o u l d raise our communal lives to the
level of a w o r l d - w i d e consensus. W h e n w e have achieved a
w o r l d - w i d e fragmentation, i t is n o t unnatural t o t h i n k about
a w o r l d - w i d e integration. Such a universality of conscious being
f o r m a n k i n d was dreamt o f b y Dante, w h o believed that men
w o u l d remain mere broken fragments u n t i l t h e y should be
united i n an inclusive consciousness. W h a t w e have today, instead
o f a social conciousness electrically ordered, however, is a private
subconsciousness o r individual " p o i n t o f v i e w " rigorously imposed
b y older mechanical technology. T h i s is a perfectly natural result
o f " c u l t u r e l a g " or conflict, i n a w o r l d suspended between t w o
technologies.
T h e ancient w o r l d associated number magically w i t h the
properties o f physical things, and w i t h the necessary causes o f
things, m u c h as science has tended u n t i l recent times t o reduce
all objects t o numerical quantities. I n any and all o f its manifestations, however, number seems t o have b o t h a u d i t o r y and repetitive resonance, and a tactile dimension as w e l l .
I t is the quality o f number that explains its p o w e r t o create
the effect of an icon or an inclusive compressed image. Such

is its use i n newspaper and magazine reporting, as : " C y c l i s t John
Jameson, 12, Collides w i t h Bus," or " W i l l i a m Samson, 51, N e w
Vice-President i n Charge of Brooms." B y rule o f t h u m b the
journalists have discovered the iconic p o w e r o f number.
Since H e n r i Bergson and the Bauhaus g r o u p o f artists, to say
n o t h i n g o f Jung and F r e u d , the nonliterate and even antiliterate
values o f tribal man have i n general received enthusiastic study and
p r o m o t i o n . For m a n y European artists and intellectuals, jazz
became one o f the r a l l y i n g points i n their quest f o r the integral
Romantic Image. T h e u n c r i t i c a l enthusiasm o f the European i n tellectual f o r tribal culture appears i n the exclamation of the
architect L e Corbusier on first seeing Manhattan: " I t is hot-jazz
i n stone." I t appears again i n the artist M o h o l y - N a g y ' s account
o f his visit to a San Francisco night club i n 1940. A N e g r o band
was p l a y i n g w i t h zest and laughter. Suddenly a player intoned,
"One million and three" and was answered: "One million
and
seven and a half." T h e n another sang, "Eleven"
and another,
"Twenty-one"
T h e n amidst " h a p p y laughter and shrill singing
the numbers t o o k over the place."
M o h o l y - N a g y notes h o w , t o Europeans, America seems t o
be the land of abstractions, where numbers have taken o n an
existence o f their o w n i n phrases like "57 Varieties," "the 5 and
10," o r "7 U p " and " b e h i n d the 8-ball." I t figures. Perhaps this is
a k i n d o f echo of an industrial culture that depends heavily o n
prices, charts, and figures. T a k e 36-24-36. Numbers cannot become more sensuously tactile than w h e n m u m b l e d as the magic
f o r m u l a f o r the female figure w h i l e the haptic hand sweeps the air.
Baudelaire had the true i n t u i t i o n o f number as a tactile
hand or nervous system f o r interrelating separate units, w h e n he
said that "number is w i t h i n the individual. Intoxication is a n u m ber." T h a t explains w h y "the pleasure o f being i n a c r o w d is a

statistically gives man a new influx o f p r i m i t i v e i n t u i t i o n and
magically subconscious awareness, whether o f public taste or
feeling: " Y o u feel better satisfied w h e n y o u use w e l l - k n o w n
brands."
L i k e money and clocks and all other forms o f measurement,
numbers acquired a separate life and intensity w i t h the g r o w t h
of literacy. Nonliterate societies had small use f o r numbers, and
today the nonliterate digital computer substitutes "yes" and " n o "
f o r numbers. T h e computer is strong o n contours, weak o n digits.
I n effect, then, the electric age brings number back i n t o u n i t y
w i t h visual and a u d i t o r y experience, f o r good or i l l .
Oswald Spengler's The Decline of the West originated i n
large part f r o m his concern w i t h the n e w mathematics. N o n Euclidean geometries, o n one hand, and the rise o f Functions i n
number theory, o n the other, seemed t o Spengler t o spell the end
o f Western man. H e had n o t grasped the fact that the invention
o f Euclidean space is, itself, a direct result of the action of the
phonetic alphabet o n the human senses. N o r had he realized that
number is an extension o f the physical b o d y of man, an extension
of our sense o f t o u c h . T h e " i n f i n i t y o f functional processes,"
i n t o w h i c h Spengler g l o o m i l y saw traditional number and geo m e t r y dissolving, is, also, the extension o f our central nervous
system i n electrical technologies. W e need n o t feel grateful t o
apocalyptic writers like Spengler, w h o see our technologies as
cosmic visitors f r o m outer space. T h e Spenglers are t r i b a l l y
entranced men w h o crave the swoon back i n t o collective u n consciousness and all the intoxication o f number. I n India the idea

matters, points out ( i n Number: The Language of Science)
that
the p a r i t y or kinesthetic sense o f these people is stronger than
their number sense. I t is certainly an indication o f a developing
visual stress i n a culture w h e n number appears. A closely i n tegrated tribal culture w i l l n o t easily y i e l d t o the separatist visual
and individualistic pressures that lead t o the division o f labor, and
then t o such accelerated forms as w r i t i n g and money. O n the

I t seems c o n t r a d i c t o r y that the fragmenting and divisive
p o w e r o f our analytic W e s t e r n w o r l d should derive f r o m an accentuation of the visual f a c u l t y . T h i s same visual sense is, also,
responsible f o r the habit o f seeing all things as continuous and
connected. Fragmentation b y means o f visual stress occurs i n that
isolation o f moment i n time, or o f aspect i n space, that is b e y o n d
the power o f touch, or hearing, or smell, or movement. B y i m posing unvisualizable relationships that are the result o f instant

feeling o f a soul passionately devoted t o the 'here' and 'now.*
Measurement i n this sense means the measurement o f something
near and corporeal."
T h e ecstatic tribal man emanates f r o m every page o f Spengler.
I t never occurred t o h i m that the ratio among corporeal things
could never be less than rational. T h a t is t o say, rationality or
consciousness is itself a ratio or p r o p o r t i o n among the sensuous
components o f experience, and is n o t something added t o such
sense experience. Subrational beings have no means o f achieving
such a ratio or p r o p o r t i o n i n their sense lives b u t are w i r e d f o r
fixed wave lengths, as i t were, having i n f a l l i b i l i t y i n their o w n
area o f experience. Consciousness, complex and subtle, can be
impaired or ended b y a mere stepping-up or d i m m i n g - d o w n of
any one sense intensity, w h i c h is the procedure i n hypnosis. A n d
the intensification of one sense b y a new medium can hypnotize
an entire c o m m u n i t y . Thus, w h e n he t h o u g h t he saw modern
mathematics and science abandoning visual relations and constructions f o r a nonvisual t h e o r y of relations and functions,
Spengler pronounced the demise o f the West.
H a d Spengler taken the time t o discover the origins of b o t h
number and Euclidean space i n the psychological effects of the
phonetic alphabet, The Decline of the West m i g h t never have
been w r i t t e n . T h a t w o r k is based o n the assumption that classical
man, A p o l l o n i a n man, was n o t the p r o d u c t of a technological bias
i n Greek culture (namely, the early impact o f literacy o n a tribal
society), b u t rather the result o f a special tremor i n the soul stuff
that embosomed the Greek w o r l d . T h i s is a strildng instance of h o w
easily men of any one particular culture w i l l panic w h e n some
familiar pattern or landmark gets smudged or shifted because o f
the indirect pressure of new media. Spengler, as m u c h as H i t l e r ,
had derived f r o m radio a subconscious mandate t o announce the
end of all " r a t i o n a l " or visual values. H e was acting like Pip i n
Dickens' Great Expectations. Pip was a poor b o y w h o had a hidden
benefactor w h o wanted to raise Pip to the status o f a gentleman.
Pip was ready and w i l l i n g u n t i l he f o u n d that his benefactor was
an escaped convict. Spengler and H i t l e r and m a n y more o f the
would-be "irrationalists" of our c e n t u r y are like singing-telegram

delivery boys, w h o are quite innocent o f any understanding o f
the medium that prompts the song they sing.
So far as Tobias D a n t z i g is concerned i n his Number:
The
Language of Science, the progress f r o m the tactile fingering o f
toes and fingers to "the homogeneous number concept, w h i c h
made mathematics possible" is the result o f visual abstraction
f r o m the operation of tactile manipulation. W e have b o t h extremes
o f this process i n our daily speech. T h e gangster t e r m " t o p u t
the finger o n " says that somebody's " n u m b e r " has come u p . A t the
extreme of the graph profiles of the statisticians there is the f r a n k l y
expressed object of manipulation o f population f o r varieties o f
p o w e r purposes. For example, i n any large stockbroker's office
there is a modern medicine man k n o w n as " M r . O d d L o t s . " H i s
magical f u n c t i o n is t o study the daily purchases and sales of the
small buyers on the b i g exchanges. L o n g experience has revealed
that these small buyers are w r o n g 80 per cent of the time. A
statistical profile of the failure of the little man t o be i n t o u c h
enables the b i g operators to be about 80 per cent r i g h t . T h u s
f r o m error comes t r u t h ; and f r o m p o v e r t y , riches, thanks t o
numbers. T h i s is the m o d e r n magic o f numbers. T h e more p r i m i tive attitude t o w a r d the magical power o f numbers appeared i n the
dread o f the English w h e n W i l l i a m the Conqueror numbered
them and their chattels i n w h a t the f o l k called the Doomsday
Book.
T o t u r n again b r i e f l y t o the question of number i n its more
l i m i t e d manifestation, Dantzig, having made clear that the idea
o f homogeneity had t o come before p r i m i t i v e numbers could be
advanced t o the level o f mathematics, points to another literate
and visual factor i n the older mathematics. "Correspondence and
succession, the t w o principles w h i c h permeate all mathematicsnay, all realms o f exact thought—are w o v e n i n t o the v e r y fabric
o f our number system," he observes. So, indeed, are they w o v e n
i n t o the v e r y fabric o f W e s t e r n logic and philosophy. W e have
already seen h o w the phonetic technology fostered visual cont i n u i t y and individual p o i n t o f v i e w , and h o w these contributed t o
the rise o f u n i f o r m Euclidean space. D a n t z i g says that i t is the
idea o f correspondence w h i c h gives us cardinal numbers. B o t h o f

114/Understanding

these spatial ideas—lineality and p o i n t o f view—come w i t h w r i t i n g ,
especially w i t h phonetic w r i t i n g ; b u t neither is necessary i n our
n e w mathematics and physics. N o r is w r i t i n g necessary t o an
electric technology. O f course, w r i t i n g and conventional arithmetic m a y l o n g continue t o be o f the utmost use t o man, f o r all
that. Even Einstein c o u l d n o t face the n e w quantum physics w i t h
c o m f o r t . T o o visual a N e w t o n i a n f o r the new task, he said that
quanta could n o t be handled mathematically. T h a t is as m u c h as t o
say that p o e t r y cannot be p r o p e r l y translated i n t o merely visual
f o r m o n the p r i n t e d page.
Dantzig develops his points about number b y saying that a
literate population soon departs f r o m the abacus and f r o m finger
enumeration, t h o u g h arithmetic manuals i n the Renaissance continued t o give elaborate rules f o r calculating on the hands. I t could
be true that numbers preceded literacy i n some cultures, b u t so d i d
visual stress precede w r i t i n g . For w r i t i n g is o n l y the principal
manifestation o f the extension o f o u r visual sense, as the photograph and the movie today may w e l l r e m i n d us. A n d l o n g before
literate technology, the b i n a r y factors o f hands and feet sufficed
t o launch man o n the path o f c o u n t i n g . Indeed, the mathematical
Leibniz saw i n the mystic elegance o f the b i n a r y system of zero
and 1 the image o f Creation. T h e u n i t y o f the Supreme Being
operating i n the v o i d b y b i n a r y f u n c t i o n w o u l d , he felt, suffice t o
make all beings f r o m the v o i d .
Dantzig reminds us also that i n the age o f manuscript there
was a chaotic v a r i e t y o f signs f o r numerals, and that they d i d
n o t assume a stable f o r m u n t i l p r i n t i n g . A l t h o u g h this was one o f
the least o f the cultural effects o f p r i n t i n g , i t should serve t o
recall that one o f the b i g factors i n the Greek adoption of the
letters o f the phonetic alphabet was the prestige and currency o f
the number system o f the Phoenician traders. T h e Romans got
the Phoenician letters f r o m the Greeks b u t retained a number
system that was m u c h more ancient. W a y n e and Shuster, the
comedian team, never fail t o get a good laugh w h e n they line
up a g r o u p o f ancient Roman cops i n togas and have them
number themselves f r o m l e f t t o r i g h t , u t t e r i n g Roman numerals.

Number/115
T h i s joke demonstrates h o w the pressure o f numbers caused men
t o seek ever more streamlined methods o f numeration. Before
the advant o f ordinal, successive, or positional numbers, rulers
had t o count large bodies o f soldiery b y displacement methods.
Sometimes they were herded b y groups i n t o spaces of approximately k n o w n area. T h e m e t h o d of having them march i n file and
o f d r o p p i n g pebbles i n t o containers was another method n o t u n related t o the abacus and the c o u n t i n g board. Eventually the
m e t h o d o f the c o u n t i n g board gave rise t o the great discovery
o f the principle o f position i n the early centuries o f our era. B y
simply p u t t i n g 3 and 4 and 2 i n position o n the board, one after
another, i t was possible t o step u p the speed and potential o f
calculation fantastically. T h e discovery o f calculation b y positional numbers rather than b y merely additive numbers led, also, t o
the discovery o f zero. M e r e positions f o r 3 and 2 o n the board
created ambiguities about whether the number was 32 or 302.
T h e need was t o have a sign f o r the gaps between numbers. I t
was n o t t i l l the thirteenth century that sifr, the A r a b w o r d f o r
" g a p " o r " e m p t y , " was Latinized and added t o our culture as
" c i p h e r " (ziphirum)
and finally became the Italian zero. Zero
really meant a positional gap. I t d i d n o t acquire the indispensable
q u a l i t y o f " i n f i n i t y " u n t i l the rise o f perspective and "vanishing
p o i n t " i n Renaissance painting. T h e n e w visual space of Renaissance painting affected number as m u c h as lineal w a i t i n g had done
centuries earlier.
A m a i n fact about numbers has n o w been reached, w i t h the
l i n k between the medieval positional zero and the Renaissance
vanishing point. T h a t b o t h vanishing p o i n t and i n f i n i t y were u n k n o w n i n the Greek and R o m a n cultures can be explained as b y products o f literacy. I t was n o t u n t i l p r i n t i n g extended the visual

special order that the other senses could be restrained or depressed
sufficiently t o create the n e w awareness o f i n f i n i t y . A s one aspect

senses. I t is i n this mode that man appears as the reproductive
organ o f the technological w o r l d , a fact that Samuel Butler
bizarrely announced i n
Ereivhon.
T h e effect o f any k i n d o f technology engenders a n e w equil i b r i u m i n us that brings quite n e w technologies t o b i r t h , as w e
have just seen i n the interplay o f number (the tactile and quantitative f o r m ) , and the more abstract forms o f w r i t t e n or visual
culture. P r i n t technology transformed the medieval zero into the
Renaissance i n f i n i t y , n o t o n l y b y convergence—perspective and
vanishing point—but b y b r i n g i n g i n t o play f o r the first time i n
human history the factor of exact repeatability. P r i n t gave t o
m e n the concept o f indefinite repetition so necessary to the
mathematical concept o f i n f i n i t y .
T h e same Gutenberg fact o f u n i f o r m , continuous, and indefi n i t e l y repeatable bits inspired also the related concept of the
infinitesimal calculus, b y w h i c h i t became possible t o translate
any k i n d o f t r i c k y space i n t o the straight, the flat, the u n i f o r m ,
and the " r a t i o n a l . " T h i s concept o f i n f i n i t y was n o t imposed
u p o n us b y logic. I t was the g i f t o f Gutenberg. So, also, later on,
was the industrial assembly line. T h e power t o translate k n o w l edge i n t o mechanical p r o d u c t i o n b y the breaking u p o f any process i n t o fragmented aspects t o be placed i n a lineal sequence o f
movable, y e t u n i f o r m , parts was the f o r m a l essence o f the p r i n t i n g
press. T h i s amazing technique o f spatial analysis duplicating itself
at once, b y a k i n d o f echo, invaded the w o r l d o f number and
touch.
Here, then, is merely one familiar, i f unrecognized, instance
o f the p o w e r o f one m e d i u m t o translate itself i n t o another
medium. Since all media are extensions of our o w n bodies and
senses, and since w e habitually translate one sense i n t o another i n
our o w n experience, i t need n o t surprise us that o u r extended
senses o r technologies should repeat the process o f translation
and assimilation o f one f o r m i n t o another. T h i s process m a y w e l l
be inseparable f r o m the character o f t o u c h , and f r o m the abrasively interfaced action o f surfaces, whether i n chemistry or
crowds or technologies. T h e mysterious need o f crowds t o g r o w
and t o reach out, equally characteristic o f large accumulations of

Number/l

wealth, can be understood i f money and numbers are, indeed,
technologies that extend the p o w e r of t o u c h and the grasp of the
hand. For numbers, whether o f people or o f digits, and units o f
money w o u l d seem t o possess the same factual magic f o r seizing
and incorporating.
T h e Greeks ran head-on i n t o the p r o b l e m o f translating their
o w n new media w h e n t h e y tried t o apply rational arithmetic t o a
p r o b l e m i n geometry. U p arose the specter o f Achilles and the
tortoise. These attempts resulted i n the first crisis i n the history
o f o u r Western mathematics. Such a crisis concerned the problems
o f determining the diagonal o f a square and the circumference of
a circle: a clear case of number, the tactile sense, t r y i n g t o cope
w i t h visual and pictorial space b y reduction o f the visual space t o
itself.
F o r the Renaissance, i t was the infinitesimal calculus that
enabled arithmetic t o take over mechanics, physics, and geometry.
T h e idea of an infinite b u t continuous and u n i f o r m process, so
basic t o the Gutenberg technology of movable types, gave rise
t o the calculus. Banish the infinite process and mathematics, pure
and applied, is reduced t o the state k n o w n t o the pre-Pythagoreans.
T h i s is t o say, banish the n e w medium o f p r i n t w i t h its fragmented
technology of u n i f o r m , lineal repeatability, and modern mathematics disappears. A p p l y , however, this infinite u n i f o r m process t o
finding the length of an arc, and all that need be done is to inscribe
i n the arc a sequence o f rectilinear contours o f an increasing
number o f sides. W h e n these contours approach a l i m i t , the
length of the arc becomes the l i m i t o f this sequence. T h e older
m e t h o d o f determining volumes b y l i q u i d displacement is thus
translated into abstract visual terms b y calculus. T h e principles
regarding the concept o f length apply also t o notions o f areas,
volumes, masses, moments, pressures, forces, stresses and strains,
velocities and accelerations.
T h e miracle-maker, the sheer f u n c t i o n o f the infinitely f r a g mented and repeatable, became the means o f making visually flat,
straight, and u n i f o r m all that was nonvisual: the skew, the curved,
and the b u m p y . I n the same w a y , the phonetic alphabet had,
centuries before, invaded the discontinuous cultures of the bar-

barians, and translated their sinuosities and obtusities into the
uniformities of the visual culture o f the W e s t e r n w o r l d . I t is this
u n i f o r m , connected, and visual order that w e still use as the
n o r m of " r a t i o n a l " l i v i n g . I n our electric age of instant and n o n visual forms of interrelation, therefore, w e f i n d ourselves at a

direct extension o f the outer surface o f the b o d y . T o d a y E u r o peans have begun t o dress f o r the eye, American-style, just at the
moment w h e n Americans have begun t o abandon their traditional
visual style. T h e media analyst k n o w s w h y these opposite styles
suddenly transfer their locations. T h e European, since the Second
W a r , has begun t o stress visual values; his economy, n o t coincidentally, n o w supports a large amount of u n i f o r m consumer
goods. Americans, o n the other hand, have begun t o rebel against
u n i f o r m consumer values f o r the first time. I n cars, i n clothes, i n
paperback books; i n beards, babies, and beehive hairdos, the
American has declared f o r stress o n t o u c h , o n participation, i n volvement, and sculptural values. A m e r i c a , once the land o f an
abstractly visual order, is p r o f o u n d l y " i n t o u c h " again w i t h
European traditions o f f o o d and l i f e and art. W h a t was an avantgarde p r o g r a m f o r the 1920 expatriates is n o w the teenagers'

T h e Europeans, however, underwent a sort o f consumer
revolution at the end of the eighteenth century. W h e n industrialism was a novelty, i t became fashionable among the upper classes
to abandon r i c h , c o u r t l y attire i n favor o f simpler materials. T h a t
was the time w h e n men first donned the trousers o f the c o m m o n
f o o t soldier ( o r pioneer, the original French usage), b u t i t was
done at that time as a k i n d o f brash gesture o f social "integrat i o n . " U p u n t i l then, the feudal system had inclined the upper
classes t o dress as they spoke, i n a c o u r t l y style quite removed
f r o m that o f o r d i n a r y people. Dress and speech were accorded
a degree of splendor and richness o f texture that universal literacy
and mass p r o d u c t i o n were eventually t o eliminate completely.
T h e sewing machine, f o r example, created the l o n g straight line
i n clothes, as m u c h as the l i n o t y p e flattened the human vocal
style.
A recent ad f o r C - E - I - R Computer Services p i c t u r e d a plain
c o t t o n dress and the headline: " W h y does M r s . ' K ' dress that
way?"—referring t o the w i f e o f N i k i t a Khrushchev. Some o f the
c o p y of this v e r y ingenious ad continued: " I t is an i c o n . T o its

T h i s is precisely the message that the n e w simple c l o t h i n g
o f our forefathers had f o r the feudal classes at the time of the
French Revolution. C l o t h i n g was then a nonverbal manifesto
of political upset.
T o d a y i n America there is a revolutionary attitude expressed as m u c h i n our attire as i n our patios and small cars. F o r
a decade and more, women's dress and hair styles have abandoned
visual f o r iconic—or sculptural and tactual—stress. L i k e toreador
pants and gaiter stockings, the beehive hairdo is also iconic and
sensuously inclusive, rather than abstractly visual. I n a w o r d , the
American w o m a n f o r the first time presents herself as a person t o
be touched and handled, n o t just t o be looked at. W h i l e the
Russians are g r o p i n g vaguely t o w a r d visual consumer values,
N o r t h Americans are f r o l i c k i n g amidst n e w l y discovered tactile,
sculptural spaces i n cars, clothes, and housing. For this reason,
i t is relatively easy f o r us n o w t o recognize c l o t h i n g as an extension o f the skin. I n the age o f the b i k i n i and o f skin-diving, w e
begin t o understand " t h e castle o f our s k i n " as a space and w o r l d
o f its o w n . Gone are the thrills of strip-tease. N u d i t y c o u l d be
naughty excitement o n l y f o r a visual culture that had divorced
itself f r o m the audile-tactile values o f less abstract societies. A s
late as 1930, four-letter w o r d s made visual o n the p r i n t e d page
seemed portentous. W o r d s that most people used every hour o f

reason they seem earthy and vigorous t o visual man. So i t is w i t h
n u d i t y . T o backward cultures still embedded i n the f u l l gamut of

t o the h i g h l y visual and lopsided sensibility of industrial societies,

T h e r e is a movement t o w a r d a n e w equilibrium today, as w e
become aware o f the preference f o r coarse, heavy textures and
sculptural shapes i n dress. T h e r e is, also, the ritualistic exposure o f
the b o d y indoors and out-of-doors. Psychologists have l o n g taught
us that m u c h o f our hearing takes place t h r o u g h the skin itself.

Literate man, civilized man, tends t o restrict and enclose

b u i l d i n g o f the ancient cities, their shape and process having been
deliberately modeled as an act o f divine praise. T h e c i t y and the
home i n the tribal w o r l d (as i n China and India t o d a y ) can be
accepted as iconic embodiments o f the word, the divine mythos,
the universal aspiration. Even i n our present electric age, many
people yearn f o r this inclusive strategy o f acquiring significance
f o r their o w n private and isolated beings.
Literate man, once having accepted an analytic technology
o f fragmentation, is n o t nearly so accessible t o cosmic patterns
as tribal man. H e prefers separateness and compartmented spaces,
rather than the open cosmos. H e becomes less inclined to accept
his b o d y as a model of the universe, or t o see his house—or
any other o f the media of communication, f o r that matter—as a
ritual extension of his b o d y . Once men have adopted the visual
dynamic o f the phonetic alphabet, t h e y begin to lose the tribal
man's obsession w i t h cosmic order and ritual as recurrent i n the
physical organs and their social extension. Indifference to the
cosmic, however, fosters intense concentration o n minute segments and specialist tasks, w h i c h is the unique strength o f Western
man. For the specialist is one w h o never makes small mistakes
while m o v i n g t o w a r d the grand fallacy.

iMen live i n r o u n d houses u n t i l they become sedentary and
specialized i n their w o r k organization. Anthropologists have o f t e n
noted this change f r o m r o u n d to square w i t h o u t k n o w i n g its cause.
T h e media analyst can help the anthropologist i n this matter,
although the explanation w i l l not be obvious to people o f visual
culture. T h e visual man, likewise, cannot see m u c h difference
between the m o t i o n picture and T V , or between a Corvair and
a Volkswagen, f o r this difference is not between t w o visual spaces,
but between tactile and visual ones. A tent or a w i g w a m is n o t an
enclosed or visual space. N e i t h e r is a cave nor a hole i n the g r o u n d .
These kinds of space—the tent, the w i g w a m , the igloo, the c a v e are n o t "enclosed" i n the visual sense because they f o l l o w dynamic
lines of force, like a triangle. W h e n enclosed, or translated i n t o
visual space, architecture tends to lose its tactile kinetic pressure.
A square is the enclosure of a visual space; that is, i t consists of
space properties abstracted f r o m manifest tensions. A triangle
f o l l o w s lines o f force, this being the most economical w a y o f
anchoring a vertical object. A square moves beyond such kinetic
pressures t o enclose visual space relations, w h i l e depending u p o n
diagonal anchors. T h i s separation of the visual f r o m direct tactile
and kinetic pressure, and its translation i n t o new dwelling spaces,
occurs o n l y w h e n men have learned t o practice specialization
o f their senses, and fragmentation o f their w o r k skills. T h e square
r o o m or house speaks the language o f the sedentary specialist,
w h i l e the r o u n d h u t or igloo, like the conical w i g w a m , tells of the
integral nomadic ways o f food-gathering communities.
T h i s entire discussion is offered at considerable risk of misapprehension because these are, spatially, h i g h l y technical matters. Nevertheless, w h e n such spaces are understood, t h e y offer
the key t o a great m a n y enigmas, past and present. T h e y explain
the change f r o m circular-dome architecture to gothic forms, a
change occasioned b y alteration i n the ratio or p r o p o r t i o n of the
sense lives i n the members of a society. Such a shift occurs w i t h
the extension of the b o d y i n n e w social technology and invention.
A n e w extension sets u p a n e w equilibrium among all of the senses
and faculties leading, as w e say, to a " n e w outlook"—new attitudes
and preferences i n many areas.

I n the simplest terms, as already noted, housing is an effort
t o extend the body's heat-control mechanism. C l o t h i n g tackles
the problem more d i r e c t l y b u t less fundamentally, and privately
rather than socially. B o t h c l o t h i n g and housing store w a r m t h and
energy and make these readily accessible f o r the execution o f
many tasks otherwise impossible. I n m a k i n g heat and energy
accessible socially, t o the f a m i l y o r the g r o u p , housing fosters
n e w skills and n e w learning, p e r f o r m i n g the basic functions o f
all other media. H e a t c o n t r o l is the k e y factor i n housing, as
w e l l as i n c l o t h i n g . T h e Eskimo's d w e l l i n g is a g o o d example.
T h e Eskimo can go f o r days w i t h o u t f o o d at 50 degrees below
zero. T h e unclad native, deprived o f nourishment, dies i n a f e w
hours.
I t may surprise many t o learn that the p r i m i t i v e shape o f the
igloo is, nonetheless, traceable t o the primus stove. Eskimos have
lived f o r ages i n r o u n d stone houses, and, f o r the most part, still do.
T h e igloo, made o f snow blocks, is a f a i r l y recent development i n
the life of this stone-age people. T o live i n such structures became
possible w i t h the c o m i n g of the w h i t e man and his portable
stove. T h e igloo is an ephemeral shelter, devised f o r temporary
use b y trappers. T h e Eskimo became a trapper o n l y after he had
made contact w i t h the w h i t e m a n ; u p u n t i l then he had been
simply a food-gatherer. L e t the igloo serve as an example o f the
w a y i n w h i c h a n e w pattern is i n t r o d u c e d i n t o an ancient w a y o f
life b y the intensification o f a single factor—in this instance,
artificial heat. I n the same w a y , the intensification o f a single factor
i n our complex lives leads naturally t o a n e w balance among our
technologically extended faculties, resulting i n a n e w l o o k and a
new " o u t l o o k " w i t h new motivations and inventions.
I n the t w e n t i e t h century w e are familiar w i t h the changes
i n housing and architecture that are the result o f electric energy
made available t o elevators. T h e same energy devoted t o l i g h t i n g
has altered our l i v i n g and w o r k i n g spaces even more radically.
Electric l i g h t abolished the divisions o f n i g h t and day, o f inner and
outer, and o f the subterranean and the terrestrial. I t altered every
consideration of space f o r w o r k and p r o d u c t i o n as m u c h as the
other electric media had altered the space-time experience o f

Housing/'127
society. A l l this is reasonably familiar. Less familiar is the architectural r e v o l u t i o n made possible b y improvements i n heating
centuries ago. W i t h the m i n i n g o f coal o n a large scale i n the
Renaissance, inhabitants i n the colder climates discovered great
n e w resources o f personal energy. N e w means o f heating perm i t t e d the manufacture o f glass and the enlargement o f l i v i n g
quarters and the raising o f ceilings. T h e Burgher house o f the
Renaissance became at once bedroom, kitchen, workshop, and
sale outlet.
Once housing is seen as g r o u p ( o r corporate) c l o t h i n g and
heat c o n t r o l , the n e w means o f heating can be understood as
causing change i n spatial f o r m . L i g h t i n g , however, is almost as
decisive as heating i n causing these changes i n architectural and
c i t y spaces. T h a t is the reason w h y the story o f glass is so closely
related t o the history o f housing. T h e story of the m i r r o r is a
main chapter i n the history o f dress and manners and the sense
o f the self.
Recently an imaginative school principal i n a slum area p r o vided each student i n the school w i t h a photograph o f himself.
T h e classrooms o f the school were abundantly supplied w i t h large
mirrors. T h e result was an astounding increase i n the learning rate.
T h e slum child has o r d i n a r i l y v e r y little visual orientation. H e does
n o t see himself as becoming something. H e does n o t envisage
distant goals and objectives. H e is deeply involved i n his o w n
w o r l d f r o m day t o day, and can establish no beachhead i n the
h i g h l y specialized sense life o f visual man. T h e p l i g h t o f the
slum child, via the T V image, is increasingly extended t o the entire
population.
C l o t h i n g and housing, as extensions o f skin and heat-control
mechanisms, are media o f communication, first o f all, i n the sense
that t h e y shape and rearrange the patterns o f human association
and c o m m u n i t y . V a r i e d techniques o f l i g h t i n g and heating w o u l d
seem o n l y t o give n e w flexibility and scope t o w h a t is the basic
principle o f these media o f c l o t h i n g and housing; namely, their
extension o f our b o d i l y heat-control mechanisms i n a w a y that
enables us t o attain some degree of equilibrium i n a changing environment.

M o d e r n engineering provides means o f housing that range
f r o m the space capsule t o walls created b y air jets. Some firms
n o w specialize i n p r o v i d i n g large buildings w i t h inside walls and
floors that can be moved at w i l l . Such f l e x i b i l i t y naturally tends
t o w a r d the organic. H u m a n sensitivity seems once more to be
attuned to the universal currents that made o f tribal man a cosmic
skin-diver.
I t is n o t o n l y the Ulysses o f James Joyce that testifies to this
trend. Recent studies of the G o t h i c churches have stressed the
organic aims o f their builders. T h e saints t o o k the b o d y seriously
as the symbolic vesture of the spirit, and they regarded the C h u r c h
as a second b o d y , v i e w i n g its every detail w i t h great completeness.
Before James Joyce provided his detailed image o f the metropolis
as a second b o d y , Baudelaire had provided a similar "dialogue"
between the parts o f the b o d y extended t o f o r m the metropolis,
i n his Fleurs du Mai.
Electric l i g h t i n g has b r o u g h t i n t o the cultural complex o f
the extensions o f man i n housing and c i t y , an organic flexibility
u n k n o w n t o any other age. I f color photography has created
"museums w i t h o u t walls," h o w m u c h more has electric l i g h t i n g
created space w i t h o u t walls, and day w i t h o u t night. W h e t h e r i n
the n i g h t c i t y , the n i g h t h i g h w a y , or the n i g h t ball game, sketchi n g and w r i t i n g w i t h l i g h t have moved f r o m the domain of the
pictorial photograph t o the live, dynamic spaces created b y o u t of-door lighting.
N o t many ages ago, glass w i n d o w s were u n k n o w n luxuries.
W i t h l i g h t c o n t r o l b y glass came also a means o f c o n t r o l l i n g the
regularity o f domestic routine, and steady application t o crafts
and trade w i t h o u t regard to cold o r rain. T h e w o r l d was p u t i n
a frame. W i t h electric l i g h t n o t o n l y can w e carry o u t the most
precise operations w i t h no regard f o r time or place or climate,
b u t w e can photograph the submicroscopic as easily as w e can
enter the subterranean w o r l d o f the mine and o f the cave-painters.
L i g h t i n g as an extension o f our powers affords the clearestcut example o f h o w such extensions alter our perceptions. I f
people are inclined to doubt whether the wheel or t y p o g r a p h y
or the plane con Id change our habits o f sense perception, their

doubts end w i t h electric lighting. I n this domain, the medium is
the message, and w h e n the l i g h t is on there is a w o r l d of sense that
disappears w h e n the l i g h t is off.
"Painting w i t h l i g h t " is jargon f r o m the w o r l d o f stageelectricity. T h e uses o f l i g h t i n the w o r l d o f m o t i o n , whether i n
the motorcar or the movie or the microscope, are as diverse as the
uses o f electricity i n the w o r l d o f power. L i g h t is information
w i t h o u t "content," m u c h as the missile is a vehicle w i t h o u t the
additions o f wheel or h i g h w a y . As the missile is a self-contained
transportation system that consumes n o t o n l y its fuel b u t its
engine, so l i g h t is a self-contained communication system i n w h i c h
the medium is the message.
T h e recent development o f the laser r a y has introduced n e w
possibilities f o r light. T h e laser r a y is an amplification of l i g h t b y
intensified radiation. Concentration of radiant energy has made
available some new properties i n light. T h e laser ray—by t h i c k ening l i g h t , as i t were—enables i t t o be modulated t o carry i n f o r m a t i o n as do radio waves. B u t because of its greater intensity,
a single laser beam can c a r r y as m u c h i n f o r m a t i o n as all the c o m bined radio and T V channels i n the U n i t e d States. Such beams

F r o m the air at n i g h t , the seeming chaos of the urban area
manifests itself as a delicate embroidery o n a dark velvet g r o u n d .
G y o r g y Kepes has developed these aerial effects of the c i t y at

than " l i g h t o n . " H i s n e w electric landscapes have complete

T h e French painter André G i r a r d began painting d i r e c t l y on

early phase i t was easy t o speculate about " p a i n t i n g w i t h l i g h t "
and about i n t r o d u c i n g movement i n t o the art o f painting. Said
Girard:
I would not be surprised if, fifty years f r o m now, almost no
one would pay attention to paintings whose subjects remain

T h e coming o f T V inspired h i m anew:
Once I saw suddenly, i n a control room, the sensitive eye
of the camera presenting to me, one after another, the faces,
the landscapes, the expressions of a big painting of mine i n an
order which I had never thought of. I had the feeling of a
composer listening to one of his operas, all scenes mixed up
i n an order different f r o m the one he wrote. I t was like seeing
a building f r o m a fast elevator that showed you the roof
before the basement, and made quick stops at some floors
but not others.
Since that phase, G i r a r d has w o r k e d out new techniques of
c o n t r o l f o r painting w i t h l i g h t i n association w i t h CBS and N B C
technicians. T h e relevance o f his w o r k f o r housing is that i t
enables us t o conceive o f t o t a l l y n e w possibilities f o r architectural
and artistic modulation o f space. Painting w i t h l i g h t is a k i n d
o f housing-without-walls. T h e same electric technology, extended
t o the job of p r o v i d i n g global thermostatic controls, points t o
the obsolescence o f housing as an extension o f the heat-control
mechanisms of the b o d y . I t is equally conceivable that the electric
extension o f the process of collective consciousness, i n making
consciousness-without-walls, m i g h t render language walls obsolescent. Languages are stuttering extensions o f our five senses, i n
v a r y i n g ratios and wavelengths. A n immediate simulation o f consciousness w o u l d by-pass speech i n a k i n d o f massive extrasensory
perception, just as global thermostats could by-pass those extensions of skin and b o d y that w e call houses. Such an extension o f

Money
The Poor Maris

Central t o m o d e r n psychoanalytical theo r y is the relation between the money
complex and the human b o d y . Some analysts derive money f r o m the infantile i m pulse t o play w i t h feces. Ferenczi, i n particular, calls money " n o t h i n g other than
odorless dehydrated filth that has been
made t o shine." Ferenczi, i n his concept
o f money, is elaborating Freud's concept
o f "Character and A n a l E r o t i s m . " A l t h o u g h this idea o f l i n k i n g " f i l t h y l u c r e "
w i t h the anal has continued i n the main
lines o f psychoanalysis, i t does n o t correspond sufficiently t o the nature and
f u n c t i o n of money i n society t o provide a

money was issued, b u t as hardship increased the population boiled
and ate the new currency.
I n literate cultures, circumstances may reintroduce c o m m o d i t y money. T h e D u t c h , after the German occupation o f
W o r l d W a r I I , were avid f o r tobacco. Since the supply was
small, objects o f high value such as jewels, precision instruments,
and even houses were sold f o r small quantities o f cigarettes. The
Reader's Digest recorded an episode f r o m the early occupation
of Europe i n 1945, describing h o w an unopened pack o f cigarettes
served as currency, passing f r o m hand t o hand, translating the
skill o f one w o r k e r into the skill o f another as l o n g as no one broke
the seal.
M o n e y always retains something of its c o m m o d i t y and c o m m u n i t y character. I n the beginning, its f u n c t i o n o f extending
the grasp o f men f r o m their nearest staples and commodities t o
more distant ones is v e r y slight. Increased m o b i l i t y o f grasp and
trading is small at first. So i t is w i t h the emergence o f language
i n the child. I n the first months grasping is reflexive, and the
p o w e r t o make v o l u n t a r y release comes o n l y t o w a r d the end o f
the first year. Speech comes w i t h the development o f the power
to let go o f objects. I t gives the p o w e r of detachment f r o m the
environment that is also the power o f great m o b i l i t y i n knowledge
of the environment. So i t is w i t h the g r o w t h of the idea o f money
as currency rather than c o m m o d i t y . C u r r e n c y is a w a y o f letting
go of the immediate staples and commodities that at first serve
as money, i n order t o extend trading t o the w h o l e social complex.
T r a d i n g b y currency is based o n the principle o f grasping and
letting go i n an oscillating cycle. T h e one hand retains the article
w i t h w h i c h i t tempts the other p a r t y . T h e other hand is extended
i n demand t o w a r d the object w h i c h is desired i n exchange. T h e
first hand lets go as soon as the second object is touched, somew h a t i n the manner of a trapeze artist exchanging one bar f o r
another. I n fact, Elias Canetti i n Crowds and Power argues that
the trader is involved i n one o f the most ancient o f all pastimes,
namely that o f c l i m b i n g trees and swinging f r o m l i m b t o l i m b .
T h e p r i m i t i v e grasping, calculating, and t i m i n g o f the greater

o f the oldest movement patterns. Just as the hand among the
branches o f the trees learned a pattern o f grasping that was
quite removed f r o m the m o v i n g o f f o o d t o m o u t h , so the trader
and the financier have developed enthralling abstract activities
that are extensions o f t h e avid c l i m b i n g and m o b i l i t y o f the
greater apes.
L i k e any other m e d i u m , i t is a staple, a natural resource. A s
an o u t w a r d and visible f o r m o f the urge t o change and t o exchange, i t is a corporate image, depending o n society f o r its
institutional status. A p a r t f r o m communal participation, money
is meaningless, as Robinson Crusoe discovered w h e n he f o u n d
the coins i n the w r e c k e d ship:
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. " O d r u g ! "
said I aloud, " W h a t art thou good for? T h o u art not w o r t h
to me—no, not the taking off the ground: one of those knives
is w o r t h all this heap: I have no manner of use for thee; e'en
remain where thou art and, go to the bottom, as a creature
whose life is not w o r t h saving."
However, upon second thoughts, I took i t away; and
wrapping i t all i n a piece of canvas, I began to think of
making another raft . . .
Primitive c o m m o d i t y money, like the magical w o r d s o f n o n literate society, can be a storehouse o f power, and has o f t e n
become the occasion o f feverish economic a c t i v i t y . T h e natives
o f the South Seas, w h e n they are so engaged, seek no economic
advantage. Furious application t o p r o d u c t i o n m a y be f o l l o w e d
b y deliberate destruction of the products i n order t o achieve
moral prestige. Even i n these " p o t l a t c h " cultures, however, t h e
effect o f the currencies was t o expedite and t o accelerate human
energies i n a w a y that had become universal i n the ancient w o r l d
w i t h the technology o f the phonetic alphabet. M o n e y , l i k e
w r i t i n g , has the p o w e r t o specialize and t o rechannel human
energies and t o separate functions, just as i t translates and reduces
one k i n d o f w o r k t o another. Even i n the electronic age i t has
lost none o f this power.
Potlatch is v e r y widespread, especially where there is ease
o f food-gathering o r f o o d - p r o d u c t i o n . F o r example, among the

N o r t h w e s t coast fishermen, or rice-planters o f Borneo, huge
surpluses are produced that have t o be destroyed o r class d i f ferences w o u l d arise that w o u l d destroy the traditional social
order. I n Borneo the traveler m a y see tons o f rice exposed t o rains
i n rituals, and great art constructions, i n v o l v i n g tremendous
efforts, smashed.
A t the same time, i n these p r i m i t i v e societies, w h i l e money

richest man is reduced to having m u c h the same entertainment,
and even the same f o o d and vehicles as the o r d i n a r y man.
T h e use of a c o m m o d i t y such as money naturally increases
its p r o d u c t i o n . T h e nonspecialist economy o f V i r g i n i a i n the
seventeenth century made the elaborate European currencies
quite dispensable. H a v i n g little capital, and w i s h i n g t o p u t as
little of this capital as possible i n t o the shape o f money, the V i r ginians turned t o c o m m o d i t y money i n some instances. W h e n a
c o m m o d i t y like tobacco was legislated i n t o legal tender, i t had
the effect o f stimulating the p r o d u c t i o n o f tobacco, just as the
establishment o f metallic currencies advanced the m i n i n g o f metals.
M o n e y , as a social means o f extending and a m p l i f y i n g w o r k
and skill i n an easily accessible and portable f o r m , lost m u c h o f
its magical p o w e r w i t h the c o m i n g o f representative money, or
paper money. Just as speech lost its magic w i t h w r i t i n g , and
f u r t h e r w i t h p r i n t i n g , w h e n p r i n t e d money supplanted gold the
compelling aura o f i t disappeared. Samuel Butler i n

medium t o o k the f o r m o f presenting the o l d reverent attitude t o

part of a penny i n the pound—this man is w o r t h ten professional philanthropists. So strongly are the Erewhonians i m pressed w i t h this, that if a man has made a fortune of over
£20,000 a year they exempt him f r o m all taxation, considering him a work of art, and too precious to be meddled w i t h ;
they say, " H o w very much he must have done for society
before society could have been prevailed upon to give him
so much money"; so magnificent an organization overawes
them; they regard i t as a thing dropped f r o m heaven.
"Money," they say, "is the symbol of duty, i t is the sacrament of having done for mankind that which mankind
wanted. Mankind may not be a very good judge, but there
is no better." This used to shock me at first, when I remembered that i t had been said on high authority that they who
have riches shall enter hardly into the kingdom of heaven;
but the influence of Erewhon had made me begin to see
things i n a new light, and I could not help thinking that they
who have not riches shall enter more hardly still.
Earlier i n the book, Butler had r i d i c u l e d the cash-register
m o r a l i t y and religion o f an industrialized w o r l d , under the guise
o f the "Musical Banks," w i t h clergy i n the role of cashiers. I n the
present passage, he perceives money as " t h e sacrament o f having
done f o r mankind that w h i c h mankind w a n t e d . " M o n e y , he is
saying, is the " o u t w a r d and visible sign o f an i n w a r d and invisible
grace."
M o n e y as a social m e d i u m or extension o f an inner w i s h and
m o t i v e creates social and spiritual values, as happens even i n
fashions i n women's dress. A current ad underlines this aspect o f
dress as currency (that is, as social sacrament or o u t w a r d and
visible sign): " T h e i m p o r t a n t t h i n g i n today's w o r l d o f fashion is
t o appear t o be wearing a popular f a b r i c . " C o n f o r m i t y t o this
fashion literally gives currency t o a style or fabric, creating a
social medium that increases wealth and expression thereby. Does

" M o n e y talks" because money is a metaphor, a transfer, and
a bridge. L i k e w o r d s and language, money is a storehouse o f c o m munally achieved w o r k , skill, and experience. M o n e y , however, is
also a specialist technology like w r i t i n g ; and as w r i t i n g intensifies
the visual aspect o f speech and order, and as the clock visually
separates time f r o m space, so money separates w o r k f r o m the
other social functions. Even today money is a language f o r
translating the w o r k o f the farmer i n t o the w o r k o f the barber,
doctor, engineer, or plumber. As a vast social metaphor, bridge,
or translator, money—like writing—speeds u p exchange and t i g h t ens the bonds o f interdependence i n any c o m m u n i t y . I t gives great
spatial extension and c o n t r o l to political organizations, just as
w r i t i n g does, o r the calendar. I t is action at a distance, b o t h i n
space and i n time. I n a h i g h l y literate, fragmented society, " T i m e
is m o n e y , " and money is the store of other people's time and
effort.
D u r i n g the M i d d l e Ages the idea of the fisc or "the King's
purse" kept the n o t i o n of money i n relation t o language ("the
King's English") and t o communication b y travel ("the King's
h i g h w a y " ) . Before the advent o f p r i n t i n g , i t was quite natural f o r
the means of communication t o be regarded as extensions o f a
single b o d y . I n an increasingly literate society, money and the
clock assumed a high degree of visual or fragmented stress. I n
practice, our W e s t e r n use o f money as store and translator of
communal w o r k and skill has depended upon l o n g accustomation
t o the w r i t t e n w o r d , and u p o n the p o w e r of the w r i t t e n w o r d to
specialize, t o delegate, and to separate functions i n an organization.
W h e n w e l o o k at the nature and uses of money i n nonliterate
societies, w e can better understand the ways i n w h i c h w r i t i n g
helps to establish currencies. U n i f o r m i t y of commodities, c o m bined w i t h a fixed-price system such as w e n o w take f o r granted,
does n o t become possible u n t i l p r i n t i n g prepares the ground.
" B a c k w a r d " countries take a l o n g time to reach economic "takeo f f " because they do not undergo the extensive processing of p r i n t
w i t h its psychological conditioning i n the ways o f u n i f o r m i t y
and repeatability. I n general, the W e s t is little aware of the w a y

Money/137
i n w h i c h the w o r l d o f prices and numbering is supported b y the
pervasive visual culture o f literacy.
Nonliterate societies are quite lacking i n the psychic resources
t o create and sustain the enormous structures o f statistical i n f o r m a t i o n that w e call markets and prices. Far easier is the o r ganization of p r o d u c t i o n than is the training o f whole populations
i n the habits of translating their wishes and desires statistically, as
i t were, b y means o f market mechanisms o f supply and demand,
and the visual technology o f prices. I t was o n l y i n the eighteenth
century that the W e s t began to accept this f o r m of extension o f
its inner life i n the new statistical pattern o f marketing. So bizarre
d i d this new mechanism appear to thinkers o f that time that they
called i t a "Hedonistic calculus." Prices then seemed t o be c o m parable, i n terms o f feelings and desires, t o the vast w o r l d o f
space that had yielded its inequities earlier to the translating p o w e r
o f the differential calculus. I n a w o r d , the fragmentation o f the
inner life b y prices seemed as mysterious i n the eighteenth cent u r y , as the minute fragmentation of space b y means o f calculus
had seemed a century earlier.
T h e extreme abstraction and detachment represented b y our
p r i c i n g system is quite unthinkable and unusable amidst populations f o r w h o m the exciting drama o f price haggling occurs w i t h
every transaction.
T o d a y , as the n e w vortices of p o w e r are shaped b y the
instant electric interdependence of all men o n this planet, the
visual factor i n social organization and i n personal experience
recedes, and money begins to be less and less a means of storing
or exchanging w o r k and skill. A u t o m a t i o n , w h i c h is electronic,
does n o t represent physical w o r k so m u c h as programmed k n o w l edge. A s w o r k is replaced b y the sheer movement of i n f o r m a t i o n , money as a store o f w o r k merges w i t h the informational
forms o f credit and credit card. F r o m coin t o paper currency, and
f r o m currency t o credit card there is a steady progression t o w a r d
commercial exchange as the movement o f i n f o r m a t i o n itself. T h i s

Its money can be eaten, d r u n k , or w o r n like the n e w space ships
that are n o w designed t o be edible.
" W o r k , " however, does n o t exist i n a nonliterate w o r l d . T h e
p r i m i t i v e hunter or fisherman d i d no w o r k , any m o r e than does
the poet, painter, or thinker o f today. W h e r e the w h o l e man is
involved there is no w o r k . W o r k begins w i t h the division o f labor
and the specialization of functions and tasks i n sedentary, agricult u r a l communities. I n the computer age w e are once more t o t a l l y
involved i n our roles. I n the electric age the " j o b o f w o r k " yields
t o dedication and commitment, as i n the tribe.
I n nonliterate societies money relates itself t o the other organs
o f society quite simply. T h e role o f money is enormously i n creased after money begins t o foster specialism and separation
of social functions. M o n e y becomes, i n fact, the p r i n c i p a l means
o f interrelating the ever more specialist activities o f literate
society. T h e fragmenting p o w e r o f the visual sense, as literacy
separates i t f r o m the other senses, is a fact more easily identified
n o w i n the electronic age. N o w a d a y s , w i t h computers and elect r i c p r o g r a m m i n g , the means o f storing and m o v i n g i n f o r m a t i o n become less and less visual and mechanical, w h i l e increasingly
integral and organic. T h e total field created b y the instantaneous
electric forms cannot be visualized any more than the velocities
of electronic particles can be visualized. T h e instantaneous creates
an interplay among time and space and human occupations, f o r
w h i c h the older forms of currency exchange become increasingly
inadequate. A modern physicist w h o attempted t o employ visual
models of perception i n organizing atomic data w o u l d n o t be able
t o get anywhere near the nature o f his problems. B o t h time (as
measured visually and segmentally) and space (as u n i f o r m , pictorial, and enclosed) disappear i n the electronic age o f instant

accomplished i n more recent times b y means o f the p r i n t e d w o r d ,
and b y m o v i n g f r o m metallic t o paper currencies. T o d a y , electric
technology puts the v e r y concept of m o n e y i n jeopardy, as the
n e w dynamics o f human interdependence shift f r o m fragmenting
media such as p r i n t i n g t o inclusive or mass media like the telegraph.
Since all media are extensions o f ourselves, or translations o f
some part o f us i n t o various materials, any study o f one m e d i u m
helps us t o understand all the others. M o n e y is no exception.
T h e p r i m i t i v e or nonliterate use o f money is especially enlightening, since i t manifests an easy acceptance o f staple products as
media o f communication. T h e nonliterate m a n can accept any
staple as money, p a r t l y because the staples o f a c o m m u n i t y are as
m u c h media o f communication as they are commodities. C o t t o n ,
wheat, cattle, tobacco, timber, fish, f u r , and m a n y other products
have acted as major shaping forces o f c o m m u n i t y life i n m a n y
cultures. W h e n one o f these staples becomes dominant as a social
b o n d , i t serves, also, as a store o f value, and as a translator o r
exchanger o f skills and tasks.
T h e classic curse o f Midas, his p o w e r o f translating all he
touched i n t o gold, is i n some degree the character o f any m e d i u m ,
i n c l u d i n g language. T h i s m y t h draws attention t o a magic aspect
o f all extensions o f human sense and b o d y ; that is, t o all technology

other functions to be altered t o accommodate that f o r m .

house of experience, language is, i n addition, a reducer and a
distorter o f experience. T h e v e r y great advantage o f accelerating
the learning process, and o f m a k i n g possible the transmission of
knowledge and insight across time and space, easily overrides the
disadvantages o f linguistic codifications of experience. I n modern
mathematics and science there are increasingly more and more
nonverbal ways o f c o d i f y i n g experience.
M o n e y , like language a store o f w o r k and experience, acts
also as translator and transmitter. Especially since the w r i t t e n
w o r d has advanced the separation o f social functions, money is
able t o move away f r o m its role as store o f w o r k . T h i s role is
obvious w h e n a staple or c o m m o d i t y like cattle or f u r is used
as money. As m o n e y separates itself f r o m the c o m m o d i t y f o r m
and becomes a specialist agent o f exchange ( o r translator of
values), i t moves w i t h greater speed and i n ever greater volume.
Even i n recent times, the dramatic arrival o f paper currency,
or "representative m o n e y , " as a substitute f o r c o m m o d i t y money
caused confusions. M u c h i n the same w a y , the Gutenberg technolo g y created a vast new republic o f letters, and stirred great confusion about the boundaries between the realms o f literature and
life. Representative money, based o n p r i n t technology, created
new speedy dimensions of credit that were quite inconsistent w i t h
the inert mass o f bullion and o f c o m m o d i t y money. Y e t all efforts
were bent t o make the speedy n e w money behave like the slow
b u l l i o n coach. J. M . Keynes stated this p o l i c y i n A Treatise
on
Money:
Thus the long age of Commodity Money has at last passed
finally away before the age of Representative Money. Gold
has ceased to be a coin, a hoard, a tangible claim to wealth,
of which the value cannot slip away so long as the hand of
the individual clutches the material stuff. I t has become a
much more abstract thing—just a standard of value; and i t
only keeps this nominal status by being handed round from
time to time i n quite small quantities amongst a group of
Central Banks, on the occasions when one of them has been
inflating or deflating its managed representative money i n a
different degree f r o m what is appropriate to the behavior of
its neighbours.

Money/141
Paper, or representative money, has specialized itself away
f r o m the ancient role o f money as a store o f w o r k i n t o the equally
ancient and basic f u n c t i o n o f money as transmitter and expediter
o f any k i n d of w o r k i n t o any other k i n d . Just as the alphabet
was a drastic visual abstraction f r o m the r i c h hieroglyphic c u l ture o f the Egyptians, so i t also reduced and translated that c u l ture i n t o the great visual vortex o f the Graeco-Roman w o r l d .
T h e alphabet is a one-way process of reduction of nonliterate
cultures into the specialist visual fragments o f our W e s t e r n w o r l d .
M o n e y is an adjunct o f that specialist alphabetic technology,
raising even the Gutenberg f o r m of mechanical repeatability t o
n e w intensity. As the alphabet neutralized the divergencies o f
p r i m i t i v e cultures b y translation of their complexities into simple
visual terms, so representative money reduced moral values i n the
nineteenth century. A s paper expedited the p o w e r of the alphabet
t o reduce the oral barbarians to Roman u n i f o r m i t y o f civilization,
so paper money enabled W e s t e r n i n d u s t r y to blanket the globe.
S h o r t l y before the advent o f paper money, the greatly i n creased volume of i n f o r m a t i o n movement i n European newsletters
and newspapers created the image and concept of N a t i o n a l Credit.
Such a corporate image of credit depended, then as n o w , o n the
fast and comprehensive i n f o r m a t i o n movement that w e have
taken f o r granted f o r t w o centuries and more. A t that stage o f
the emergence of public credit, money assumed the f u r t h e r role
o f translating, not just local, b u t national stores o f w o r k f r o m one
culture t o another.
One o f the inevitable results of acceleration of i n f o r m a t i o n
movement and o f the translating power o f money is the opport u n i t y o f enrichment f o r those w h o can anticipate this transf o r m a t i o n b y a f e w hours or years, as the case may be. W e are
particularly familiar today w i t h examples o f enrichment b y
means o f advance i n f o r m a t i o n i n stocks and bonds and real estate.
I n the past, w h e n wealth was n o t so obviously related t o i n f o r m a t i o n , an entire social class c o u l d monopolize the wealth resulting
f r o m a casual shift i n technology. Keynes' r e p o r t o f just such an i n stance, i n his study o f "Shakespeare and the P r o f i t Inflations,"
explains that since new wealth and b u l l i o n fall first t o the g o v -

erning classes, they experience a sudden buoyancy and euphoria,
a glad release f r o m the habitual stress and anxieties that fosters a
prosperity, w h i c h i n t u r n inspires the starving artist i n his garret t o
invent n e w t r i u m p h a n t r h y t h m s and exultant forms o f painting
and poetry. As l o n g as profits leap w e l l ahead o f wages, the governing class cavorts i n a style that inspires the greatest c o n ceptions i n the bosom o f the impecunious artist. W h e n , however,
profits and wages keep i n reasonable t o u c h , this abounding j o y
o f the governing class is correspondingly diminished, and art
then cannot benefit f r o m prosperity.
Keynes discovered the dynamics o f money as a medium. T h e
real task o f a study o f this one m e d i u m is identical w i t h that o f
the study o f all media; namely, as Keynes w r o t e , " t o treat the
problem dynamically, analyzing the different elements involved, i n
such a manner as to exhibit the causal process b y w h i c h the price
level is determined, and the method o f transition f r o m one posit i o n o f equilibrium t o another."
I n a w o r d , money is not a closed system, and does n o t have
its meaning alone. As a translator and amplifier, m o n e y has exceptional powers o f substituting one k i n d o f t h i n g f o r another.
I n f o r m a t i o n analysts have come t o the conclusion that the degree
t o w h i c h one resource can be substituted f o r another increases
w h e n i n f o r m a t i o n increases. As w e k n o w more, w e r e l y less o n
any one f o o d or f u e l or r a w material. Clothes and f u r n i t u r e can
n o w be made f r o m many different materials. M o n e y , w h i c h had
been f o r many centuries the principal transmitter and exchanger
o f i n f o r m a t i o n , is n o w having its f u n c t i o n increasingly transferred
t o science and automation.
T o d a y , even natural resources have an informational aspect.
T h e y exist b y v i r t u e o f the culture and skill o f some c o m m u n i t y . T h e reverse, however, is true also. A l l media—or extension o f
man—are natural resources that exist b y virtue o f the shared k n o w l edge and skill o f a c o m m u n i t y . I t was awareness o f this aspect o f
money that h i t Robinson Crusoe v e r y hard w h e n he visited the
w r e c k , resulting i n the meditation quoted at the beginning of this
chapter.
W h e n there are goods b u t no money, some sort o f barter—

Money/143
or direct exchange o f one p r o d u c t f o r another—has t o occur.
W h e n , however, i n nonliterate societies goods are used i n direct
exchange, then i t is easiest t o note their tendency t o include the
f u n c t i o n o f money. Some w o r k has been done t o some material,
i f o n l y i n b r i n g i n g i t f r o m a distance. T h e object, then, stores
w o r k and i n f o r m a t i o n or technical knowledge t o the extent that
something has been done t o i t . W h e n the one object is exchanged
f o r another, i t is already assuming the f u n c t i o n o f money, as
translator or reducer o f m u l t i p l e things t o some c o m m o n denominator. T h e common denominator ( o r translator) is, however, also
a time-saver and expediter. A s such, money is time, and i t w o u l d
be hard t o separate labor-saving f r o m time-saving i n this operation.
T h e r e is a mystery about the Phoenicians, w h o , although t h e y
were avid maritime traders, adopted coinage later than the landed
Lydians. T h e reason assigned f o r this delay m a y n o t explain the
Phoenician problem, b u t i t draws sharp attention t o a basic fact
about money as a m e d i u m ; namely, that those w h o traded b y
caravan required a l i g h t and portable m e d i u m o f payment. T h i s
need was less f o r those w h o , like the Phoenicians, traded b y sea.
P o r t a b i l i t y , as a means o f expediting and extending the effective
distance o f action, was also notably illustrated b y papyrus. T h e
alphabet was one t h i n g w h e n applied t o clay or stone, and quite
another w h e n set d o w n o n l i g h t papyrus. T h e resulting leap
i n speed and space created the Roman E m p i r e .
I n the industrial age the increasingly exact measurement o f
w o r k revealed time-saving as a major aspect o f labor-saving.
T h e media of money and w r i t i n g and clock began t o converge

M o n e y i n one o f its features provides a natural transition t o
number because the m o n e y hoard or collection has m u c h i n c o m m o n w i t h the c r o w d . Moreover, the psychological patterns o f

Just as a great r e v o l u t i o n i n mathematics came w h e n positional, tandem n u m bers were discovered (302 instead o f 32,

sense o f duration and our impatience w h e n
w e cannot endure the delay between
events. Such a sense o f impatience, or o f
time as duration, is u n k n o w n among n o n literate cultures. Just as work began w i t h

the division o f labor, duration begins w i t h the division o f time,
and especially w i t h those subdivisions b y w h i c h mechanical clocks
impose u n i f o r m succession o n the time sense.
As a piece o f technology, the clock is a machine that p r o duces u n i f o r m seconds, minutes, and hours on an assembly-line
pattern. Processed i n this u n i f o r m w a y , time is separated f r o m the
r h y t h m s o f human experience. T h e mechanical clock, i n short,
helps t o create the image o f a numerically quantified and mechanically powered universe. I t was i n the w o r l d o f the medieval
monasteries, w i t h their need f o r a rule and f o r synchronized
order t o guide communal life, that the clock g o t started o n its
modern developments. T i m e measured n o t b y the uniqueness o f
private experience b u t b y abstract u n i f o r m units gradually pervades all sense life, m u c h as does the technology o f w r i t i n g and
p r i n t i n g . N o t o n l y w o r k , b u t also eating and sleeping, came t o
accommodate themselves t o the clock rather than t o organic needs.
As the pattern o f arbitrary and u n i f o r m measurement o f time
extended itself across society, even c l o t h i n g began to undergo
annual alteration i n a w a y convenient f o r industry. A t that point,
of course, mechanical measurement o f time as a principle of
applied knowledge joined forces w i t h p r i n t i n g and assembly line
as means o f u n i f o r m fragmentation o f processes.
T h e most integral and i n v o l v i n g time sense imaginable is that
expressed i n the Chinese and Japanese cultures. U n t i l the coming
of the missionaries i n the seventeenth century, and the i n t r o d u c t i o n
o f the mechanical clocks, the Chinese and Japanese had f o r t h o u sands o f years measured time b y graduations of incense. N o t o n l y
the hours and days, b u t the seasons and zodiacal signs were simultaneously indicated b y a succession o f carefully ordered scents.
T h e sense o f smell, l o n g considered the r o o t of m e m o r y and the
u n i f y i n g basis o f individuality, has come t o the f o r e again i n the
experiments o f W i l d e r Penfield. D u r i n g brain surgery, electric
p r o b i n g o f brain tissue revived m a n y memories o f the patients.
These evocations were dominated and unified b y unique scents
and odors that structured these past experiences. T h e sense o f
smell is n o t o n l y the most subtle and delicate of the human senses;
i t is, also, the most iconic i n that i t involves the entire human

Clocks/Hi
sensorium more f u l l y than any other sense. I t is n o t surprising,
therefore, that h i g h l y literate societies take steps t o reduce or eliminate odors f r o m the environment. B.O., the unique signature and
declaration of human individuality, is a bad w o r d i n literate
societies. I t is far too i n v o l v i n g f o r our habits o f detachment and
specialist attention. Societies that measured time scents w o u l d tend
t o be so cohesive and so p r o f o u n d l y unified as t o resist every
k i n d o f change.
Lewis M u m f o r d has suggested that the clock preceded the
p r i n t i n g press i n order o f influence o n the mechanization o f
society. B u t M u m f o r d takes no account o f the phonetic alphabet
as the technology that had made possible the visual and u n i f o r m
fragmentation o f time. M u m f o r d , i n fact, is unaware o f the alphabet as the source o f W e s t e r n mechanism, just as he is unaware
o f mechanization as the translation o f society f r o m audile-tactile
modes i n t o visual values. O u r new electric technology is organic
and nonmechanical i n tendency because i t extends, n o t our eyes,
b u t o u r central nervous systems as a planetary vesture. I n the
space-time w o r l d o f electric technology, the older mechanical
time begins to feel unacceptable, i f o n l y because i t is u n i f o r m .

time exist f o r them as there are kinds o f life. T h i s , also, is the
k i n d of time-sense held b y the modern physicist and scientist.
T h e y no longer t r y to contain events i n time, b u t t h i n k of each
t h i n g as making its o w n time and its o w n space. Moreover, n o w
that w e live electrically i n an instantaneous w o r l d , space and time
interpenetrate each other t o t a l l y i n a space-time w o r l d . I n the
same w a y , the painter, since Cézanne, has recovered the plastic
image b y w h i c h all o f the senses coexist i n a unified pattern. Each
object and each set of objects engenders its o w n unique space b y
the relations i t has among others visually or musically. W h e n this
awareness recurred i n the W e s t e r n w o r l d , i t was denounced as the
merging o f all things i n a flux. W e n o w realize that this anxiety
was a natural literary and visual response t o the n e w nonvisual
technology.
J. Z. Y o u n g , i n Doubt and Certainty in Science, explains h o w
electricity is n o t something that is conveyed b y or contained i n
anything, b u t is something that occurs w h e n t w o or more bodies
are i n special positions. O u r language derived f r o m phonetic
technology cannot cope w i t h this n e w v i e w o f knowledge. W e
still talk o f electric current " f l o w i n g , " or w e speak o f the "discharge" o f electric energy like the lineal firing of guns. B u t quite
as m u c h as w i t h the esthetic magic o f painterly power, "electricity
is the c o n d i t i o n w e observe w h e n there are certain spatial relations between things." T h e painter learns h o w to adjust relations
among things t o release n e w perception, and the chemist and
physicist learn h o w other relations release other kinds o f power.
Less and less, i n the electric age, can w e find any g o o d reason f o r
imposing the same set of relations o n every k i n d o f object or group
o f objects. Y e t i n the ancient w o r l d the o n l y means o f achieving
p o w e r was getting a thousand slaves to act as one man. D u r i n g
the M i d d l e Ages the communal clock extended b y the bell perm i t t e d h i g h coordination of the energies of small communities.
I n the Renaissance the clock combined w i t h the u n i f o r m respectability of the new t y p o g r a p h y t o extend the p o w e r o f social
organization almost to a national scale. B y the nineteenth century
i t had provided a technology o f cohesion that was inseparable

Clocks/149
f r o m industry and transport, enabling an entire metropolis to act
almost as an automaton. N o w i n the electric age of decentralized
p o w e r and i n f o r m a t i o n w e begin to chafe under the u n i f o r m i t y o f
clock-time. I n this age of space-time w e seek m u l t i p l i c i t y , rather

marching soldiers and ballet.
I t is a necessary approach i n understanding media and technolo g y t o realize that w h e n the spell o f the g i m m i c k or an extension
of our bodies is new, there comes narcosis or n u m b i n g to the

u n t i l the electric age had made their mechanical sort of time
starkly incongruous. I n our electric century the mechanical t i m e kept c i t y looks like an aggregation of somnambulists and zombies,
made familiar i n the early part of T . S. Eliot's The Waste Land.
O n a planet reduced to village size b y new media, cities

overlaid w i t h new patterns of culture. H o w e v e r , w h e n mechanical
clocks had been given great new force and practicality b y mechanical w r i t i n g , as p r i n t i n g was at first called, the response to the

I n Sonnet LX, Shakespeare puts mechanical time at the beginning,
and the new engine o f i m m o r t a l i t y ( p r i n t ) at the end:
Like as the waves make towards the pibled shore,
So do our minuites hasten to their end,
Each changing place w i t h that which goes before,
I n sequent toil all forwards do contend. . . .
A n d yet to times i n hope, m y verse shall stand
Praising t h y worth, dispight his cruell hand.
John Donne's poem on " T h e Sun R i s i n g " exploits the contrast between aristocratic and bourgeois time. T h e one trait that
most damned the bourgeoisie o f the nineteenth c e n t u r y was their
punctuality, their pedantic devotion t o mechanical-time and sequential order. As space-time flooded t h r o u g h the gates o f awareness f r o m the n e w electric technology, all mechanical observance
became distasteful and even ridiculous. Donne had the same ironic
sense o f the irrelevance o f clock-time, b u t pretended that i n the
k i n g d o m o f love even the great cosmic cycles o f time were also
p e t t y aspects o f the clock:
Busy old fool, unruly Sun,
W h y dost thou thus
Through windows, and through curtains call on us?
Must to t h y motions lovers' seasons run?
Saucy, pedantic wretch, go chide
Late school-boys, and sour prentices,
Go tell Court-huntsmen, that the K i n g w i l l ride,
Call country ants to harvest offices,
Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,
N o r hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.
M u c h o f Donne's t w e n t i e t h - c e n t u r y vogue was due t o his
challenging the a u t h o r i t y o f the n e w Gutenberg age t o invest
h i m w i t h the stigmata of u n i f o r m repeatable t y p o g r a p h y and w i t h
the motives of precise visual measurement. I n like manner, A n d r e w
Marvell's " T o his C o y Mistress" was f u l l o f contempt f o r the
new spirit o f measurement and calculation o f time and virtue:
Had we but world enough and time,
This coyness, lady, were no crime

Clocks/151
W e would sit down and think which way
T o walk, and pass our long love's day. . . .
A n hundred years should go to praise
Thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze;
T w o hundred to adore each breast,
But thirty thousand to the rest;
A n age at least to every part,
A n d the last age should show your heart,
For lady, you deserve this state,
N o r would I love at lower rate.
M a r v e l l merged the rates o f exchange w i t h the rates o f praise
suited t o the conventional and fashionably fragmented outlook
o f his inamorata. For her box-office approach t o reality, he substituted another time-structure, and a different model of perception.
I t is n o t unlike Hamlet's " L o o k o n this picture and o n t h a t . "
Instead o f a quiet bourgeois translation o f the medieval love code
i n t o the language o f the n e w middle-class tradesman, w h y n o t a

Time's winged chariot hurrying near;

Deserts of vast eternity.

the electronic age, w h i c h f o u n d that instant speeds abolish time
and space, and r e t u r n man to an integral and primitive awareness.
T o d a y n o t o n l y clock-time, b u t the wheel itself, is obsolescent
and is retracting into animal f o r m under the impulse of greater
and greater speeds. I n the poem above, A n d r e w Marvell's i n t u i t i o n that clock-time could be defeated b y speed was quite sound.
A t present the mechanical begins t o y i e l d to organic u n i t y under
conditions o f electric speeds. M a n n o w can look back at t w o or
three thousand years o f v a r y i n g degrees of mechanization w i t h f u l l
awareness o f the mechanical as an interlude between t w o great
organic periods of culture. I n 1911 the Italian sculptor Boccioni
said, " W e are primitives o f an u n k n o w n c u l t u r e . " H a l f a century
later w e k n o w a b i t more about the n e w culture of the electronic
age, and that knowledge has l i f t e d the mystery surrounding the
machine.
As contrasted w i t h the mere t o o l , the machine is an extension
or outering of a process. T h e t o o l extends the fist, the nails, the
teeth, the arm. T h e wheel extends the feet i n rotation or sequential
movement. P r i n t i n g , the first complete mechanization o f a handicraft, breaks up the movement o f the hand i n t o a series o f discrete
steps that are as repeatable as the wheel is r o t a r y . F r o m this anal y t i c sequence came the assembly-line principle, b u t the assembly
line is n o w obsolete i n the electric age because synchronization
is no longer sequential. B y electric tapes, synchronization of any
number of different acts can be simultaneous. T h u s the mechanical
principle o f analysis i n series has come to an end. Even the wheel
has n o w come t o an end i n principle, although the mechanical
stratum o f our culture carries i t still as part o f an accumulated
momentum, an archaic configuration.
T h e m o d e r n clock, mechanical i n principle, embodied the
wheel. T h e clock has ceased t o have its older meanings and f u n c tions. Plurality-of-times succeeds u n i f o r m i t y - o f - t i m e . T o d a y i t is
o n l y too easy t o have dinner i n N e w Y o r k and indigestion i n Paris.
Travelers also have the daily experience o f being at one hour i n a
culture that is still 3000 B . C . , and at the next hour i n a culture that
is 1900 A.D. Most of N o r t h A m e r i c a n life is, i n its externals, conducted on nineteeth-century lines. O u r inner experience, i n -

Clocks/153
creasingly at variance w i t h these mechanical patterns, is electric,
inclusive, and m y t h i c i n mode. T h e m y t h i c or iconic mode o f
awareness substitutes the multi-faceted f o r p o i n t - o f - v i e w .
Historians agree o n the basic role o f the clock i n monastic
life f o r the synchronization o f human tasks. T h e acceptance of
such fragmenting o f life i n t o minutes and hours was unthinkable,
save i n h i g h l y literate communities. Readiness to submit the human
organism to the alien mode of mechanical time was as dependent
u p o n literacy i n the first Christian centuries as i t is today. F o r the
clock t o dominate, there has t o be the p r i o r acceptance o f the
visual stress that is inseparable f r o m phonetic literacy. L i t e r a c y is
itself an abstract asceticism that prepares the w a y f o r endless
patterns o f privation i n the human c o m m u n i t y . W i t h universal
literacy, time can take o n the character of an enclosed or pictorial
space that can be divided and subdivided. I t can be filled-in. " M y
schedule is filled u p . " I t can be kept free: " I have a free week next
m o n t h . " A n d as Sebastian de Grazia has shown i n Of Time,
Work
and Leisure, all the free t i m e i n the w o r l d is n o t leisure, because
leisure accepts neither the division o f labor that constitutes
" w o r k , " nor the divisions o f time that create " f u l l t i m e " and "free
t i m e . " Leisure excludes times as a container. Once time is mechanically or visually enclosed, divided, and filled, i t is possible
to use i t more and more efficiently. T i m e can be transformed
i n t o a labor-saving machine, as Parkinson reveals i n his famous
"Parkinson's L a w . "
T h e student o f the history of the clock w i l l find that a t o tally n e w principle entered w i t h the invention of the mechanical
clock. T h e earliest mechanical clocks had retained the o l d p r i n ciple o f the continuous action o f the d r i v i n g force, such as was
used i n the water clock and i n the water wheel. I t was about
1300 A . D . that the step was taken o f m o m e n t a r i l y i n t e r r u p t i n g
r o t a r y movement b y a c r o w n r o d and balance wheel. T h i s f u n c t i o n was called "escapement" and was the means o f literally translating the continuous force o f the wheel i n t o the visual principle
o f u n i f o r m b u t segmented succession. Escapement introduced the
reciprocal reversing action o f the hands i n r o t a t i n g a spindle f o r w a r d and backward. T h e meeting i n the mechanical clock of this

154/ Understanding

Media

ancient extension o f hand movement w i t h the f o r w a r d r o t a r y
m o t i o n o f the wheel was, i n effect, the translation o f hands i n t o
feet, and feet i n t o hands. Perhaps no more difficult technological
extension o f interinvolved b o d i l y appendages could be f o u n d . T h e
source o f the energy o f the clock was thus separated f r o m the
hands, or the source o f i n f o r m a t i o n , b y technological translation.
Escapement as a translation o f one k i n d o f wheel space into u n i f o r m and visual space is thus a direct anticipation o f the i n f i n i tesimal calculus that translates any k i n d o f space or movement i n t o
a u n i f o r m , continuous, and visual space.
Parkinson, sitting o n the fence between the mechanical and
the electric uses o f w o r k and time, is able t o provide us w i t h real
entertainment b y simply squinting, n o w w i t h one eye, n o w w i t h
the other, at the time and w o r k picture. Cultures like ours, poised
at the p o i n t o f transformation, engender b o t h tragic and comic
awareness i n great abundance. I t is the maximal interplay of d i verse forms o f perception and experience that makes great the
cultures o f the f i f t h century B . C . , the sixteenth century, and the
twentieth century. B u t f e w people have enjoyed l i v i n g i n these
intense periods w h e n all that ensures f a m i l i a r i t y and security dissolves and is reconfigured i n a f e w decades.
I t was n o t the clock, b u t literacy reinforced b y the clock, that
created abstract time and led men t o eat, n o t w h e n t h e y were
h u n g r y , b u t w h e n i t was "time t o eat." Lewis M u m f o r d makes a
telling observation w h e n he says that the abstract mechanical timesense o f the Renaissance enabled men t o live i n the classical
past, and t o tear themselves o u t o f their o w n present. H e r e again,
i t was the p r i n t i n g press that made possible the re-creation o f the
classic past b y mass p r o d u c t i o n o f its literature and texts. T h e
establishment o f a mechanical and abstract time pattern soon
extends itself t o periodic alteration o f c l o t h i n g styles, m u c h i n the
same w a y that mass p r o d u c t i o n extends itself t o periodic publicat i o n o f newspapers and magazines. T o d a y w e take f o r granted that
the job of Vogue magazine is t o alter the dress styles as part of the
process o f its being printed at all. W h e n a t h i n g is current, i t
creates currency; fashion creates wealth b y m o v i n g textiles and
making them ever more current. T h i s process w e have seen at

Clocks/155
w o r k i n the section o n " M o n e y . " Clocks are mechanical media
that transform tasks and create new w o r k and wealth b y accelerati n g the pace of human association. B y coordinating and accelerati n g human meetings and goings-on, clocks increase the sheer
q u a n t i t y o f human exchange.
I t is n o t really incongruous, therefore, w h e n M u m f o r d associates "the clock and the p r i n t i n g press and the blast furnace"
as the giant innovations o f the Renaissance. T h e clock, as m u c h
as the blast furnace, speeded the m e l t i n g o f materials and the rise
o f smooth c o n f o r m i t y i n the contours of social life. L o n g before
the industrial r e v o l u t i o n o f the later eighteenth century, people
complained that society had become a "prose machine" that
whisked them t h r o u g h l i f e at a dizzy pace.
T h e clock dragged man o u t of the w o r l d o f seasonal r h y t h m s
and recurrence, as effectively as the alphabet had released h i m
f r o m the magical resonance o f the spoken w o r d and the tribal t r a p .
T h i s dual translation of the individual o u t o f the g r i p o f N a t u r e
and o u t o f the c l u t c h o f the tribe was n o t w i t h o u t its o w n penalties. B u t the r e t u r n to N a t u r e and the r e t u r n t o the tribe are under
electric conditions, fatally simple. W e need beware o f those w h o
announce programs f o r restoring man t o the original state and
language of the race. These crusaders have never examined the
role of media and technology i n tossing man about f r o m dimension
to dimension. T h e y are like the somnambulistic A f r i c a n chief
w i t h the alarm clock strapped t o his back.
Mircea Eliade, professor of comparative religion, is unaware,
i n The Sacred and the Profane, that a "sacred" universe i n his
sense is one dominated b y the spoken w o r d and b y a u d i t o r y
media. A " p r o f a n e " universe, on the other hand, is one dominated
b y the visual sense. T h e clock and the alphabet, b y hacking the
universe i n t o visual segments, ended the music o f interrelation.
T h e visual desacralizes the universe and produces the "nonreligious
man o f modern societies."
Historically, however, Eliade is useful i n recounting h o w ,
before the age o f the clock and the time-kept c i t y , there was f o r
t r i b a l man a cosmic clock and a sacred time of the cosmogony
itself. W h e n tribal man wanted t o b u i l d a c i t y or a house, or cure

156/Understanding

Media

an illness, he w o u n d up the cosmic clock b y an elaborate ritual
reenactment or recitation of the original process o f creation. Eliade
mentions that i n F i j i "the ceremony f o r installing a n e w ruler
is called 'creation of the w o r l d . ' " T h e same drama is enacted t o
help the g r o w t h o f crops. Whereas m o d e r n man feels obligated t o
be punctual and conservative o f time, tribal man bore the responsibility f o r keeping the cosmic clock supplied w i t h energy.
B u t electric or ecological man (man o f the total field) can be
expected t o surpass the o l d tribal cosmic concern w i t h the A f r i c a
within.
Primitive man lived i n a m u c h more tyrannical cosmic machine than W e s t e r n literate man has ever invented. T h e w o r l d of
the ear is more embracing and inclusive than that o f the eye can
ever be. T h e ear is hypersensitive. T h e eye is cool and detached.
T h e ear turns man over t o universal panic w h i l e the eye, extended
b y literacy and mechanical time, leaves some gaps and some islands
free f r o m the u n r e m i t t i n g acoustic pressure and reverberation.

T h e art o f m a k i n g pictorial statements i n

whose efforts resembled m o d e r n nonobjective art. T h e shock o f
the new Renaissance space is still f e l t b y natives w h o encounter
i t today f o r the first time. Prince M o d u p e tells i n his autobiography, I Was a Savage, h o w he had learned t o read maps at
school, and h o w he had taken back home t o his village a map o f
a river his father had traveled f o r years as a trader.
. . . m y father thought the whole idea was absurd. H e refused to identify the stream he had crossed at Bomako,
where i t is no deeper, he said, than a man is high, w i t h the
great widespread waters of the vast Niger delta. Distances
as measured in miles had no meaning for him. . . . Maps are
liars, he told me briefly. From his tone of voice I could tell
that I had offended him i n some way not known to me at
the time. The things that hurt one do not show on a map.
The truth of a place is in the joy and the hurt that come
from i t . I had best not put m y trust in anything as inadequate
as a map, he counseled. . . . I understand now, although I did
not at the time, that m y airy and easy sweep of map-traced
staggering distances belittled the journeys he had measured
on tired feet. W i t h m y big map-talk, I had effaced the magnitude of his cargo-laden, heat-weighted treks.
A l l the w o r d s i n the w o r l d cannot describe an object like
a bucket, although i t is possible t o tell i n a f e w w o r d s h o w t o
make a bucket. T h i s inadequacy o f w o r d s t o convey visual i n f o r m a t i o n about objects was an effectual b l o c k t o the development o f the Greek and Roman sciences. P l i n y the Elder reported
the inability of the Greek and L a t i n botanists to devise a means o f
transmitting i n f o r m a t i o n about plants and flowers:
Hence it is that other writers have confined themselves to
a verbal description of the plants; indeed some of them have
not so much as described them even, but have contented
themselves f o r the most part w i t h a bare recital of their
names . . .
W e are c o n f r o n t e d here once more w i t h that basic f u n c t i o n o f
media—to store and t o expedite i n f o r m a t i o n . Plainly, to store is
t o expedite, since w h a t is stored is also more accessible than w h a t
has t o be gathered. T h e fact that visual i n f o r m a t i o n about flowers
and plants cannot be stored verbally also points to the fact that

science i n the W e s t e r n w o r l d has l o n g been dependent o n the
visual factor. N o r is this surprising i n a literate culture based o n
the technology o f the alphabet, one that reduces even spoken
language t o a visual mode. As electricity has created multiple n o n visual means of storing and retrieving i n f o r m a t i o n , n o t o n l y c u l ture b u t science also has shifted its entire base and character. F o r
the educator, as w e l l as the philosopher, exact knowledge o f w h a t
this shift means f o r learning and the mental process is n o t necessary.
W e l l before Gutenberg's development o f p r i n t i n g f r o m m o v able types, a great deal of p r i n t i n g on paper b y w o o d c u t had been
done. Perhaps the most popular f o r m o f this k i n d o f b l o c k p r i n t i n g o f text and image had been i n the f o r m o f the Biblia
Pauperum, o r Bibles o f the Poor. Printers i n this w o o d c u t sense
preceded typographic printers, t h o u g h b y just h o w l o n g a period
i t is n o t easy t o establish, because these cheap and popular prints,
despised b y the learned, were n o t preserved any more than are
the comic books of today. T h e great l a w o f bibliography comes
i n t o play i n this matter of the p r i n t i n g that precedes Gutenberg:

Medieval and Renaissance man experienced little o f the
separation and specialty among the arts that developed later. T h e
manuscript and the earlier printed books w e r e read aloud, and
p o e t r y was sung or intoned. O r a t o r y , music, literature, and d r a w i n g were closely related. A b o v e all, the w o r l d o f the illuminated
manuscript was one i n w h i c h lettering itself was given plastic
stress t o an almost sculptural degree. I n a study o f the art o f
Andrea Mantegna, the illuminator o f manuscripts, M i l l a r d Meiss
mentions that, amidst the flowery and leafy margins of the page,
Mantegna's letters "rise like monuments, stony, stable and finely
cut. . . . Palpably soled and w e i g h t y , t h e y stand b o l d l y before
the colored ground, u p o n w h i c h they o f t e n t h r o w a shadow. . .
T h e same feeling f o r the letters o f the alphabet as engraved
icons has returned i n our o w n day i n the graphic arts and i n advertising display. Perhaps the reader w i l l have encountered the

sense o f this c o m i n g change i n Rimbaud's sonnet on the vowels, or
i n some o f Braque's paintings. B u t o r d i n a r y newspaper headline
style tends to push letters t o w a r d the iconic f o r m , a f o r m that is
v e r y near t o a u d i t o r y resonance, as i t is also t o tactile and sculptural quality.
Perhaps the supreme quality o f the p r i n t is one that is lost
o n us, since i t has so casual and obvious an existence. I t is simply
that i t is a pictorial statement that can be repeated precisely and
indefinitely—at least as l o n g as the p r i n t i n g surface lasts. Repeatability is the core o f the mechanical principle that has dominated
our w o r l d , especially since the Gutenberg technology. T h e message o f the p r i n t and o f t y p o g r a p h y is p r i m a r i l y that o f repeatability. W i t h t y p o g r a p h y , the principle o f movable t y p e i n t r o duced the means o f mechanizing any handicraft b y the process of
segmenting and fragmenting an integral action. W h a t had begun
w i t h the alphabet as a separation o f the m u l t i p l e gestures and
sights and sounds i n the spoken w o r d , reached a n e w level of
intensity, first w i t h the w o o d c u t and then w i t h t y p o g r a p h y . T h e
alphabet l e f t the visual component as supreme i n the w o r d , reduci n g all other sensuous facts o f the spoken w o r d t o this f o r m . T h i s
helps t o explain w h y the w o o d c u t , and even the photograph, were
so eagerly welcomed i n a literate w o r l d . These forms provide a
w o r l d of inclusive gesture and dramatic posture that necessarily is
omitted i n the w r i t t e n w o r d .
T h e p r i n t was eagerly seized u p o n as a means o f i m p a r t i n g
information, as w e l l as an incentive t o piety and meditation. I n
1472 the Art of War b y V o l t u r i u s was p r i n t e d at Verona, w i t h
many woodcuts t o explain the machinery o f w a r . B u t the uses
o f the w o o d c u t as an aid t o contemplation i n Books o f H o u r s ,
Emblems, and Shepherds' Calendars continued f o r t w o hundred
years o n a large scale.
I t is relevant t o consider that the o l d prints and woodcuts,
like the modern comic strip and comic book, provide v e r y little
data about any particular moment i n time, or aspect i n space, o f
an object. T h e viewer, or reader, is compelled t o participate i n
completing and interpreting the f e w hints provided b y the b o u n d i n g lines. N o t unlike the character o f the w o o d c u t and the car-

t o o n is the T V image, w i t h its v e r y l o w degree o f data about
objects, and the resulting high degree of participation b y the
viewer i n order to complete w h a t is o n l y hinted at i n the mosaic
mesh o f dots. Since the advent of T V , the comic book has gone
i n t o a decline.
I t is, perhaps, obvious enough that i f a cool medium involves
the viewer a great deal, a h o t medium w i l l not. I t may contradict
popular ideas t o say that t y p o g r a p h y as a hot medium involves the
reader m u c h less than d i d manuscript, or t o p o i n t out that the
comic book and T V as cool media involve the user, as maker
and participant, a great deal.
A f t e r the exhaustion o f the Graeco-Roman pools o f slave labor,
the W e s t had to technologize more intensively than the ancient
w o r l d had done. I n the same w a y the American farmer, conf r o n t e d w i t h new tasks and opportunities, and at the same time
w i t h a great shortage o f human assistance, was goaded i n t o a
f r e n z y o f creation o f labor-saving devices. I t w o u l d seem that the
logic o f success i n this matter is the ultimate retirement of the
w o r k force f r o m the scene o f t o i l . I n a w o r d , automation. I f this,
however, has been the motive behind all of our human technologies, i t does not f o l l o w that w e are prepared t o accept the
consequences. I t helps t o get one's bearings to see the process at
w o r k i n remote times w h e n w o r k meant specialist servitude, and
leisure alone meant a life o f human d i g n i t y and involvement o f
the w h o l e man.
T h e p r i n t i n its clumsy woodcut-phase reveals a major
aspect o f language; namely, that words cannot bear sharp definit i o n i n daily use. W h e n Descartes surveyed the philosophical
scene at the beginning of the seventeenth century, he was appalled
at the confusion o f tongues and began t o strive t o w a r d a reduct i o n o f philosophy t o precise mathematical f o r m . T h i s striving
f o r an irrelevant precision served o n l y to exclude f r o m philosophy
most o f the questions of philosophy; and that great k i n g d o m of
philosophy was soon parceled out i n t o the w i d e range of u n communicating sciences and specialties w e k n o w today. Intensity

creasing precision and q u a n t i t y o f visual i n f o r m a t i o n transformed
the p r i n t i n t o a three-dimensional w o r l d o f perspective and fixed

like t o live straddled between the t w o w o r l d s o f the o l d and the
new d u r i n g this r e v o l u t i o n . Simultaneously, Bosch provided the
older k i n d o f plastic, tactile image b u t placed i t i n the intense

o f unique, discontinuous space, superimposed o n the n e w idea o f

Lewis C a r r o l l t o o k the nineteenth century i n t o a dream w o r l d
that was as startling as that o f Bosch, b u t b u i l t o n reverse p r i n ciples. Alice in Wonderland offers as n o r m that continuous time
and space that had created consternation i n the Renaissance. Pervading this u n i f o r m Euclidean w o r l d of familiar space-and-time,
Carroll drove a fantasia o f discontinuous space-and-time that
anticipated K a f k a , Joyce, and E l i o t . Carroll, the mathematical
contemporary o f Clerk M a x w e l l , was quite avant-garde enough
t o k n o w about the non-Euclidean geometries c o m i n g i n t o vogue
i n his time. H e gave the confident Victorians a p l a y f u l foretaste
o f Einsteinian time-and-space i n Alice in Wonderland. Bosch had
provided his era a foretaste o f the n e w continuous time-and-space
o f u n i f o r m perspective. Bosch looked ahead t o the m o d e r n w o r l d
w i t h h o r r o r , as Shakespeare d i d i n King Lear, and as Pope d i d i n
The Dunciad. B u t Lewis C a r r o l l greeted the electronic age of

Nigerians s t u d y i n g at A m e r i c a n universities are sometimes

shadows w i l l f a l l , f o r this involves casting i n t o three-dimensional
perspective. T h u s sun, objects, and observer are experienced
separately and regarded as independent o f one another. For medieval man, as f o r the native, space was n o t homogeneous and
d i d n o t contain objects. Each t h i n g made its o w n space, as i t still
does f o r the native (and equally f o r the modern physicist). O f

T h e y often contrive the most complicated, sophisticated c o n figurations. N e i t h e r artist n o r observer has the slightest trouble

A n anthropological film showed a Melanesian carver c u t t i n g
o u t a decorated d r u m w i t h such skill, coordination, and ease
that the audience several times broke i n t o applause—it became a

I n the l o w definition w o r l d o f the medieval w o o d c u t , each
object created its o w n space, and there was no rational connected
space i n t o w h i c h i t must fit. A s the retinal impression is intensified, objects cease t o cohere i n a space o f their o w n making, and,
instead, become "contained" i n a u n i f o r m , continuous, and
" r a t i o n a l " space. R e l a t i v i t y t h e o r y i n 1905 announced the dissolut i o n o f u n i f o r m N e w t o n i a n space as an illusion or fiction, however

I t was thanks t o the p r i n t that Dickens
became a comic w r i t e r . H e began as a p r o vider o f c o p y f o r a popular cartoonist. T o
consider the comics here, after " T h e P r i n t , "
is to fix attention u p o n the persistent p r i n t like, and even crude w o o d c u t , characteristics of our t w e n t i e t h - c e n t u r y comics. I t
is b y no means easy t o perceive h o w the
same qualities o f p r i n t and w o o d c u t could
reappear i n the mosaic mesh of the T V
image. T V is so difficult a subject f o r
literary people that i t has t o be approached
obliquely. F r o m the three m i l l i o n dots per
second o n T V , the viewer is able t o accept,
i n an iconic grasp, o n l y a f e w dozen,
seventy or so, f r o m w h i c h to shape an
image. T h e image thus made is as crude
as that o f the comics. I t is f o r this reason
that the p r i n t and the comics provide a
useful approach t o understanding the T V
image, f o r t h e y offer v e r y little visual
i n f o r m a t i o n or connected detail. Painters
and sculptors, however, can easily under-

Comics/165
stand T V , because they sense h o w v e r y m u c h tactile involvement
is needed f o r the appreciation of plastic art.
T h e structural qualities of the p r i n t and w o o d c u t obtain, also,
i n the cartoon, all o f w h i c h share a participational and d o - i t - y o u r self character that pervades a w i d e variety o f media experiences
today. T h e p r i n t is clue t o the comic cartoon, just as the cartoon
is clue t o understanding the T V image.
M a n y a w r i n k l e d teenager recalls his fascination w i t h that
pride of the comics, the " Y e l l o w K i d " o f Richard F. Outcault.
O n first appearance, i t was called "Hogan's A l l e y " i n the N e w
Y o r k Sunday World. I t featured a variety o f scenes o f kids f r o m
the tenements, Maggie and Jiggs as children, as i t were. T h i s
feature sold many papers i n 1898 and thereafter. Hearst soon
b o u g h t i t , and began large-scale comic supplements. Comics (as
already explained i n the chapter o n T h e P r i n t ) , being l o w i n
definition, are a h i g h l y participational f o r m o f expression, perf e c t l y adapted to the mosaic f o r m of the newspaper. T h e y p r o vide, also, a sense o f c o n t i n u i t y f r o m one day t o the next. T h e
individual news i t e m is v e r y l o w i n i n f o r m a t i o n , and requires
completion or fill-in b y the reader, exactly as does the T V image,
or the w i r e p h o t o . T h a t is the reason w h y T V h i t the comic-book
w o r l d so hard. I t was a real rival, rather than a complement. B u t
T V h i t the pictorial ad w o r l d even harder, dislodging the sharp
and glossy, i n favor o f the shaggy, the sculptural, and the tactual.
Hence the sudden eminence o f MAD magazine w h i c h offers,
merely, a ludicrous and cool replay of the forms of the hot media
o f p h o t o , radio, and film. MAD is the o l d p r i n t and w o o d c u t
image that recurs i n various media today. Its t y p e o f configurat i o n w i l l come to shape all of the acceptable T V offerings.
T h e biggest casualty o f the T V impact was A l Capp's " L i ' l
A b n e r . " For eighteen years A l Capp had kept L i ' l A b n e r o n the
verge o f m a t r i m o n y . T h e sophisticated f o r m u l a used w i t h his
characters was the reverse o f that employed b y the French n o v elist Stendhal, w h o said, " I simply involve m y people i n the c o n sequences of their o w n stupidity and then give them brains so
t h e y can suffer." A l Capp, i n effect, said, " I simply involve m y
people i n the consequences of their o w n stupidity and then take

away their brains so that they can do n o t h i n g about i t . " T h e i r
inability to help themselves created a sort o f p a r o d y o f all the
other suspense comics. A l Capp pushed suspense i n t o absurdity.
B u t readers have l o n g enjoyed the fact that the D o g p a t c h predicament of helpless ineptitude was a paradigm o f the human
situation, i n general.
W i t h the arrival o f T V and its iconic mosaic image, the
everyday life situations began t o seem v e r y square, indeed. A l
Capp suddenly f o u n d that his k i n d o f distortion no longer w o r k e d .
H e f e l t that Americans had lost their power to laugh at t h e m selves. H e was w r o n g . T V simply involved everybody i n everyb o d y more deeply than before. T h i s cool m e d i u m , w i t h its m a n date o f participation i n depth, required Capp t o refocus the L i ' l
A b n e r image. H i s confusion and dismay were a perfect match f o r
the feelings of those i n every major A m e r i c a n enterprise. F r o m
Life to General M o t o r s , and f r o m the classroom t o the Executive
Suite, a refocusing o f aims and images to p e r m i t ever more
audience involvement and participation has been inevitable. Capp
said: " B u t n o w America has changed. T h e humorist feels the
change more, perhaps, than anyone. N o w there are things about
America w e can't k i d . "
D e p t h involvement encourages everyone t o take himself
m u c h more seriously than before. As T V cooled off the A m e r i c a n
audience, g i v i n g i t new preferences and new orientation of sight
and sound and t o u c h and taste, A l Capp's w o n d e r f u l b r e w also
had t o be toned d o w n . T h e r e was no more need t o k i d D i c k
T r a c y or the suspense routines. A s MAD magazine discovered, the
new audience f o u n d the scenes and themes of o r d i n a r y life as
f u n n y as a n y t h i n g i n remote D o g p a t c h . MAD magazine simply
transferred the w o r l d of ads i n t o the w o r l d o f the comic book,
and i t d i d this just w h e n the T V image was beginning t o eliminate
the comic book b y direct r i v a l r y . A t the same time, the T V image
rendered the sharp and clear photographic image as b l u r and blear.
T V cooled off the ad audience u n t i l the c o n t i n u i n g vehemence of
the ads and entertainment suited the p r o g r a m of the MAD magazine w o r l d v e r y w e l l . T V , i n fact, t u r n e d the previous h o t media

o f photo, f i l m , and radio i n t o a comic-strip w o r l d b y simply feat u r i n g them as overheated packages. T o d a y the ten-year-old
clutches his or her MAD ( " B u i l d u p y o u r Ego w i t h
MAD")
i n the same w a y that the Russian beatnik treasures an o l d Presley

suddenly switched t o jazz, the K r e m l i n w o u l d have reason t o
crumble. I t w o u l d be almost as effective as i f the Russian citizens
had copies of Sears Roebuck catalogues t o goggle at, instead o f
our dreary propaganda f o r the American w a y o f life.
Picasso has l o n g been a fan of A m e r i c a n comics. T h e h i g h b r o w , f r o m Joyce to Picasso, has l o n g been devoted t o American
popular art because he finds i n i t an authentic imaginative react i o n t o official action. Genteel art, o n the other hand, tends
merely t o evade and disapprove o f the blatant modes of action i n a
p o w e r f u l high definition, or "square," society. Genteel art is a
k i n d o f repeat o f the specialized acrobatic feats o f an industrialized
w o r l d . Popular art is the c l o w n r e m i n d i n g us of all the l i f e and
f a c u l t y that w e have o m i t t e d f r o m our daily routines. H e ventures
t o p e r f o r m the specialized routines o f the society, acting as integral
man. B u t integral man is quite inept i n a specialist situation. T h i s ,
at least, is one w a y t o get at the art o f the comics, and the art o f
the c l o w n .
T o d a y our ten-year-olds, i n v o t i n g f o r MAD, are telling us
i n their o w n w a y that the T V image has ended the consumer
phase o f American culture. T h e y are n o w t e l l i n g us w h a t the
eighteen-year-old beatniks were first t r y i n g t o say ten years ago.
T h e pictorial consumer age is dead. T h e iconic age is u p o n us.
W e n o w toss to the Europeans the package that concerned us
f r o m 1922 t o 1952. T h e y , i n t u r n , enter their first consumer age o f
standardized goods. W e move i n t o our first depth-age of art-andproducer orientation. A m e r i c a is Europeanizing o n as extensive a
pattern as Europe is Americanizing.
W h e r e does this leave the older popular comics? W h a t about
" B l o n d i e " and " B r i n g i n g U p Father"? Theirs was a pastoral w o r l d
o f p r i m a l innocence f r o m w h i c h y o u n g America has clearly graduated. T h e r e was still adolescence i n those days, and there were

still remote ideals and private dreams, and visualizable goals,
rather than vigorous and ever-present corporate postures f o r
g r o u p participation.
T h e chapter o n T h e P r i n t indicated h o w the cartoon is a d o - i t yourself f o r m o f experience that has developed an ever more
vigorous life as the electric age advanced. T h u s , all electric appliances, far f r o m being labor-saving devices, are new forms of
w o r k , decentralized and made available to everybody. Such is,
also, the w o r l d of the telephone and the T V image that demands
so m u c h more o f its users than does radio or movie. As a simple
consequence o f this participational and do-it-yourself aspect o f
the electric technology, every k i n d of entertainment i n the T V
age favors the same k i n d o f personal involvement. Hence the
paradox that, i n the T V age, Johnny can't read because reading,
as customarily taught, is too superficial and consumerlike an act i v i t y . Therefore the h i g h b r o w paperback, because o f its depth
character, may appeal to youngsters w h o spurn o r d i n a r y narrative
offerings. Teachers today f r e q u e n t l y f i n d that students w h o can't
read a page of history are becoming experts i n code and linguistic
analysis. T h e problem, therefore, is n o t that Johnny can't read,
b u t that, i n an age of depth involvement, Johnny can't visualize
distant goals.
T h e first comic books appeared i n 1935, N o t having anyt h i n g connected or literary about them, and being as difficult t o
decipher as the Book of Kelts, they caught on w i t h the y o u n g .
T h e elders of the tribe, w h o had never noticed that the o r d i n a r y
newspaper was as frantic as a surrealist art exhibition, c o u l d hardly
be expected to notice that the comic books were as exotic as
eighth-century illuminations. So, having noticed n o t h i n g about
the form, they c o u l d discern n o t h i n g of the contents, either. T h e
mayhem and violence were all t h e y noted. Therefore, w i t h naive
literary logic, they waited f o r violence t o flood the w o r l d . O r ,
alternatively, they attributed existing crime to the comics. T h e
dimmest-witted convict learned t o moan, " I t w u z comic books
done this t o me."
Meantime, the violence of an industrial and mechanical environment had t o be lived and given meaning and motive i n the

and tame as a rabbit h u t c h . W e called this normal. W e paid
people to keep i t at the highest p i t c h o f intensity because i t
paid w e l l . W h e n the entertainment industries tried t o provide
a reasonable facsimile o f the o r d i n a r y c i t y vehemence, eyebrows
were raised.
I t was A l Capp w h o discovered that u n t i l T V , at least, any
degree of Scragg mayhem or Phogbound m o r a l i t y was accepted
as f u n n y . He didn't t h i n k i t was f u n n y . H e p u t i n his strip just
exactly w h a t he saw around h i m . B u t our trained incapacity t o
relate one situation t o another enabled his sardonic realism t o be
mistaken f o r humor. T h e more he showed the capacity o f people
t o involve themselves i n hideous difficulties, along w i t h their entire
inability t o t u r n a hand t o help themselves, the more t h e y
giggled. "Satire," said S w i f t , "is a glass i n w h i c h w e see every
countenance b u t our o w n . "
T h e comic strip and the ad, then, b o t h belong to the w o r l d
o f games, t o the w o r l d o f models and extensions of situations
elsewhere. MAD magazine, w o r l d o f the w o o d c u t , the p r i n t , and

f r o m the w o r l d of entertainment. MAD is a l a n d o f newspaper
mosaic o f the ad as entertainment, and entertainment as a f o r m
o f madness. A b o v e all, i t is a p r i n t - and w o o d c u t - f o r m of expression and experience whose sudden appeal is a sure index of deep
changes i n our culture. O u r need n o w is t o understand the f o r m a l

Electric means o f m o v i n g o f i n f o r m a t i o n are altering our t y p o graphic culture as sharply as p r i n t modified medieval manuscript

and speed pour u p o n h i m , instantaneously and continuously, the
concerns of all other men. H e becomes tribal once more. T h e
human f a m i l y becomes one tribe again.
A n y student o f the social history of the p r i n t e d book is l i k e l y
to be puzzled b y the lack o f understanding o f the psychic and
social effects o f p r i n t i n g . I n five centuries explicit comment and
awareness o f the effects of p r i n t o n human sensibility are v e r y
scarce. B u t the same observation can be made about all the extensions o f man, whether i t be c l o t h i n g or the computer. A n extension
appears t o be an amplification of an organ, a sense or a f u n c t i o n ,
that inspires the central nervous system t o a self-protective gesture
o f n u m b i n g of the extended area, at least so far as direct inspection
and awareness are concerned. I n d i r e c t comment o n the effects
o f the p r i n t e d book is available i n abundance i n the w o r k of
Rabelais, Cervantes, Montaigne, S w i f t , Pope, and Joyce. T h e y
used t y p o g r a p h y to create n e w art forms.
Psychically the p r i n t e d book, an extension o f the visual
f a c u l t y , intensified perspective and the fixed p o i n t o f v i e w . A s sociated w i t h the visual stress o n p o i n t o f v i e w and the vanishing
point that provides the illusion o f perspective there comes another
illusion that space is visual, u n i f o r m and continuous. T h e linearity
precision and u n i f o r m i t y of the arrangement of movable types are
inseparable f r o m these great cultural forms and innovations o f
Renaissance experience. T h e n e w intensity of visual stress and
private p o i n t o f v i e w i n the first century o f p r i n t i n g were united
t o the means o f self-expression made possible b y the typographic
extension o f man.
Socially, the typographic extension o f man b r o u g h t i n nationalism, industrialism, mass markets, and universal literacy and education. For p r i n t presented an image o f repeatable precision that

tions, b o t h m i l i t a r y and commercial.
Perhaps the most significant o f the gifts o f t y p o g r a p h y to man
is that of detachment and noninvolvement—the p o w e r to act w i t h o u t reacting. Science since the Renaissance has exalted this g i f t
w h i c h has become an embarrassment i n the electric age, i n w h i c h
all people are involved i n all others at all times. T h e v e r y w o r d
"disinterested," expressing the loftiest detachment and ethical i n t e g r i t y o f typographic man, has i n the past decade been increasi n g l y used t o mean: " H e couldn't care less." T h e same i n t e g r i t y
indicated b y the t e r m "disinterested" as a m a r k o f the scientific
and scholarly temper o f a literate and enlightened society is n o w
increasingly repudiated as "specialization" and fragmentation o f
knowledge and sensibility. T h e fragmenting and analytic p o w e r
o f the p r i n t e d w o r d i n our psychic lives gave us that "dissociation
o f sensibility" w h i c h i n the arts and literature since Cezanne and
since Baudelaire has been a t o p p r i o r i t y f o r elimination i n every
p r o g r a m o f r e f o r m i n taste and knowledge. I n the " i m p l o s i o n "
o f the electric age the separation of t h o u g h t and feeling has come
t o seem as strange as the departmentalization of knowledge i n
schools and universities. Y e t i t was precisely the power to separate
t h o u g h t and feeling, t o be able t o act w i t h o u t reacting, that split
literate man out o f the tribal w o r l d o f close f a m i l y bonds i n
private and and social life.
T y p o g r a p h y was no more an addition to the scribal art than
the motorcar was an addition t o the horse. P r i n t i n g had its "horseless carriage" phase o f being misconceived and misapplied d u r i n g
its first decades, w h e n i t was n o t u n c o m m o n f o r the purchaser o f
a p r i n t e d book t o take i t t o a scribe t o have i t copied and i l lustrated. Even i n the early eighteenth c e n t u r y a " t e x t b o o k " was
still defined as a "Classick A u t h o r w r i t t e n v e r y w i d e b y the
Students, t o give r o o m f o r an Interpretation dictated b y the

spent i n making such texts. T h e classroom tended to be a scriptorium w i t h a commentary. T h e student was an editor-publisher.

I t never ceases t o oppress the older media u n t i l i t finds new
shapes and positions f o r them. Manuscript culture had sustained
an oral procedure i n education that was called "scholasticism"
at its higher levels; b u t b y p u t t i n g the same text i n f r o n t of any

T h e open society is open b y v i r t u e o f a u n i f o r m typographic

T h e psychic and social consequences o f p r i n t included an
extension of its fissile and u n i f o r m character t o the gradual
homogenization o f diverse regions w i t h the resulting amplificat i o n o f power, energy, and aggression that w e associate w i t h n e w
nationalisms. Psychically, the visual extension and amplification
o f the individual b y p r i n t had many effects. Perhaps as s t r i k i n g
as any other is the one mentioned b y M r . E. M . Forster, w h o ,
w h e n discussing some Renaissance types, suggested that " t h e
p r i n t i n g press, then o n l y a century o l d , had been mistaken f o r
an engine o f i m m o r t a l i t y , and men had hastened t o c o m m i t t o
i t deeds and passions f o r the benefit of f u t u r e ages." People began
t o act as though i m m o r t a l i t y were inherent i n the magic repeata b i l i t y and extensions o f p r i n t .
A n o t h e r significant aspect of the u n i f o r m i t y and repeatability
o f the printed page was the pressure i t exerted t o w a r d " c o r r e c t "
spelling, syntax, and pronunciation. Even more notable were the
effects o f p r i n t i n separating p o e t r y f r o m song, and prose f r o m
o r a t o r y , and popular f r o m educated speech. I n the matter o f p o e t r y

hear, Shakespeare p r o v i d e d an image or model of the process o f
quantification and fragmentation as i t entered the w o r l d o f politics
and o f f a m i l y life. Lear at the v e r y opening o f the play presents
" o u r darker purpose" as a plan of delegation o f powers and duties:
Only we shall retain
The name, and all t h ' addition to a K i n g ;
The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
This coronet part between you.

k i n g d o m , and his f a m i l y . Y e t t o divide and rule was the dominant

new idea o f the organization o f power i n the Renaissance. " O u r
darker purpose" refers t o Machiavelli himself, w h o had developed
an individualist and quantitative idea of power that struck more
fear i n that time than M a r x i n ours. P r i n t , then, challenged the
corporate patterns of medieval organization as m u c h as electricity
n o w challenges our fragmented individualism.
T h e u n i f o r m i t y and repeatability of p r i n t permeated the
Renaissance w i t h the idea of time and space as continuous measurable quantities. T h e immediate effect o f this idea was t o desacralize
the w o r l d o f nature and the w o r l d o f power alike. T h e n e w technique of c o n t r o l o f physical processes b y segmentation and f r a g mentation separated G o d and N a t u r e as m u c h as M a n and N a t u r e ,
or man and man. Shock at this departure f r o m traditional vision
and inclusive awareness was often directed t o w a r d the figure of
Machiavelli, w h o had merely spelled o u t the n e w quantitative
and neutral or scientific ideas of force as applied t o the manipulat i o n of kingdoms.
Shakespeare's entire w o r k is taken up w i t h the themes of the
new delimitations of power, b o t h k i n g l y and private. N o greater
h o r r o r could be imagined i n his time than the spectacle o f Richard
I I , the sacral k i n g , undergoing the indignities of imprisonment and
denudation of his sacred prerogatives. I t is i n Troilus and Cressida,
however, that the new cults o f fissile, irresponsible power, public
and private, are paraded as a cynical charade o f atomistic competition^
Take the instant way;
For honour travels i n a strait so narrow
Where one but goes abreast: keep, then, the path;
For emulation hath a thousand sons
That one by one pursue: i f you give way,
O r hedge aside from the direct forthright,
Like to an enter'd tide they all rush by
A n d leave you hindmost . . .
(HI, iii)

quantified appetites shadows Shakespeare's vision i n the later plays.
O f the many unforeseen consequences of t y p o g r a p h y , the

emergence of nationalism is, perhaps, the most familiar. Political
unification of populations b y means of vernacular and language
groupings was unthinkable before p r i n t i n g turned each vernacular
i n t o an extensive mass m e d i u m . T h e tribe, an extended f o r m o f a
f a m i l y of blood relatives, is exploded b y p r i n t , and is replaced
b y an association o f men homogeneously trained to be individuals.
Nationalism itself came as an intense n e w visual image o f group
destiny and status, and depended on a speed o f i n f o r m a t i o n movement u n k n o w n before p r i n t i n g . T o d a y nationalism as an image
still depends on the press b u t has all the electric media against i t .
I n business, as i n politics, the effect of even jet-plane speeds is t o
render the older national groupings of social organization quite
unworkable. I n the Renaissance i t was the speed of p r i n t and the
ensuing market and commercial developments that made nationalism ( w h i c h is c o n t i n u i t y and competition i n homogeneous space)
as natural as i t was new. B y the same token, the heterogeneities
and noncompetitive discontinuities of medieval guilds and f a m i l y
organization had become a great nuisance as speed-up o f i n f o r m a t i o n b y p r i n t called f o r more fragmentation and u n i f o r m i t y o f
f u n c t i o n . T h e Benvenuto Cellinis, the goldsmith-cum-paintercum-sculptor-cum-writer-cum-condottiere, became obsolete.
Once a new technology comes i n t o a social milieu i t cannot
cease t o permeate that milieu u n t i l every institution is saturated.
T y p o g r a p h y has permeated every phase o f the arts and sciences
i n the past five hundred years. I t w o u l d be easy to document the
processes b y w h i c h the principles of c o n t i n u i t y , u n i f o r m i t y , and
repeatability have become the basis o f calculus and of marketing,
as o f industrial p r o d u c t i o n , entertainment, and science. I t w i l l be
enough t o point out that repeatability conferred o n the p r i n t e d
b o o k the strangely novel character o f a u n i f o r m l y priced c o m m o d i t y opening the door t o price systems. T h e printed book had
i n addition the q u a l i t y o f p o r t a b i l i t y and accessibility that had been
lacking i n the manuscript.
D i r e c t l y associated w i t h these expansive qualities was the
r e v o l u t i o n i n expression. U n d e r manuscript conditions the role o f
being an author was a vague and uncertain one, like that of a
minstrel. Hence, self-expression was o f little interest. T y p o g r a p h y ,

U n i f o r m i t y reached also i n t o areas o f speech and w r i t i n g ,

Extended to the spoken w o r d , this literate equitone enabled literate
people to maintain a single " h i g h t o n e " i n discourse that was
quite devastating, and enabled nineteenth-century prose writers
t o assume m o r a l qualities that f e w w o u l d n o w care t o simulate.

Wheel,

T h e kinds of interplay between wheel,

w h o have never t h o u g h t about them.
Scholars tend t o w o r k o n the archeological
assumption that things need t o be studied
i n isolation. T h i s is the habit o f specialism
that quite naturally derives f r o m t y p o graphic culture. W h e n a scholar like L y n n
W h i t e ventures t o make some interrelations, even i n his o w n area o f special historical study, he causes a good deal o f u n happiness among his merely specialist c o l leagues. I n his Medieval Technology
and
Social Change he explains h o w the feudal
system was a social extension of the stirr u p . T h e stirrup first appeared i n the
W e s t i n the eighth c e n t u r y A . D . , having
been introduced f r o m the East. W i t h the
stirrup came mounted shock combat that
called i n t o existence a n e w social class. T h e
European cavalier class had already existed

of ten or more peasant holdings. Charlemagne demanded that less
prosperous freemen merge their private farms to equip a single
k n i g h t f o r the wars. T h e pressure o f the new w a r technology
gradually developed classes and an economic system that could
provide numerous cavaliers i n heavy armor. B y about the year
1000 A . D . the o l d w o r d miles had changed f r o m "soldier" t o
"knight."
L y n n W h i t e has m u c h t o say, also, about horseshoes and
horsecollars as revolutionary technology that increased the power
and extended the range and speed o f human action i n the early
M i d d l e Ages. H e is sensitive to the psychic and social implications
o f each technological extension o f man, showing h o w the heavy
wheel-plow b r o u g h t about a new order i n the field system, as w e l l
as i n the diet of that age. " T h e M i d d l e Ages were literally f u l l o f
beans."
T o come more d i r e c t l y t o our subject o f the wheel, L y n n
W h i t e explains h o w the evolution o f the wheel i n the M i d d l e Ages
was related t o the development of the horsecollar and the harness.
T h e greater speed and endurance o f the horse was n o t available
f o r cartage u n t i l the discovery o f the collar. B u t once evolved,
this horse-harness led to the development of wagons w i t h pivoted
f r o n t axles and brakes. T h e f o u r - w h e e l w a g o n capable o f hauling
heavy loads was a c o m m o n feature b y the middle of the thirteenth
century. T h e effects o n t o w n life were extraordinary. Peasants
began t o live i n cities w h i l e going each day to their fields, almost
i n the manner o f motorized Saskatchewan farmers. These latter
live mainly i n the c i t y , having no housing i n the c o u n t r y beyond
sheds f o r their tractors and equipment.
W i t h the c o m i n g of the horse-drawn bus and streetcar,
American t o w n s developed housing that was no longer w i t h i n
sight of shop or f a c t o r y . T h e railroad next t o o k over the development of the suburbs, w i t h housing kept w i t h i n w a l k i n g distance
o f the railroad stop. Shops and hotels around the railroad gave
some concentration and f o r m t o the suburb. T h e automobile,
f o l l o w e d b y the airplane, dissolved this g r o u p i n g and ended the
pedestrian, or human, scale of the suburb. Lewis M u m f o r d contends that the car turned the suburban housewife i n t o a f u l l - t i m e

o f tasks, and architect of ever-new human relations, is far f r o m
finished, b u t its shaping p o w e r is w a n i n g i n the electric age o f i n f o r m a t i o n , and that fact makes us m u c h more aware of its characteristic f o r m as n o w tending t o w a r d the archaic.
Before the emergence of the wheeled vehicle, there was
merely the abrasive t r a c t i o n principle—runners, skids, and skis
preceded wheels f o r vehicles, just as the abrasive, semirotary
m o t i o n o f the hand-operated spindle and d r i l l preceded the f u l l ,
free r o t a r y m o t i o n o f the potter's wheel. T h e r e is a moment o f
translation or "abstraction" needed to separate the reciprocating
movement of hand f r o m the free movement o f wheel. "Doubtless
the n o t i o n of the wheel came originally f r o m observing that
r o l l i n g a l o g was easier than shoving i t , " writes Lewis M u m f o r d
i n Technics and Civilization.
Some m i g h t object that l o g - r o l l i n g
is closer t o the spindle operation of the hands than t o the r o t a r y
movement of feet, and need never have g o t translated i n t o the
technology of wheel. U n d e r stress, i t is m o r e natural t o fragment
our o w n b o d i l y f o r m , and t o let part of i t go i n t o another material,
than i t is t o transfer any o f the motions of external objects i n t o
another material. T o extend our b o d i l y postures and motions i n t o
n e w materials, b y w a y o f amplification, is a constant drive f o r
more power. Most o f our b o d i l y stresses are interpreted as needs
f o r extending storage and m o b i l i t y functions, such as occur, also,
i n speech, money, and w r i t i n g . A l l manner of utensils are a y i e l d i n g t o this b o d i l y stress b y means of extensions of the b o d y .
T h e need f o r storage and p o r t a b i l i t y can readily be noted i n
vases, jars, and "slow matches" (stored fire).
Perhaps the main feature of all tools and machines—economy
o f gesture—is the immediate expression o f any physical pressure
w h i c h impels us to outer o r t o extend ourselves, whether i n w o r d s
or i n wheels. M a n can say i t w i t h flowers or plows or l o c o m o tives. I n " K r a z y K a t , " Ignatz said i t w i t h bricks.
One of the most advanced and complicated uses of the wheel
occurs i n the movie camera and i n the movie projector. I t is significant that this most subtle and complex g r o u p i n g of wheels should
have been invented i n order to w i n a bet that all f o u r feet o f

T h i s bet was made between the pioneer photographer E d w a r d
M u y b r i d g e and horse-owner Leland Stanford, i n 1889. A t first,
a series o f cameras were set up side b y side, each t o snap an arrested moment o f the horse's hooves i n action. T h e movie camera
and the projector were evolved f r o m the idea o f reconstructing
mechanically the movement o f feet. T h e wheel, that began as
extended feet, t o o k a great evolutionary step i n t o the movie
theater.
B y an enormous speed-up o f assembly-line segments, the

disappears into the plane at take-off, and the plane becomes a
missile, a self-contained transportation system. A t this p o i n t the
wheel is reabsorbed into the f o r m o f b i r d or fish that the plane
becomes as i t takes t o the air. Skin-divers need no path o r road,
and claim that their m o t i o n is like that o f b i r d flight; their feet
cease to exist as the progressive, sequential movement that is the
o r i g i n of r o t a r y action o f the wheel. U n l i k e w i n g or f i n , the wheel
is lineal and requires road f o r its completion.
I t was the tandem alignment of wheels that created the
velocipede and then the bicycle, f o r w i t h the acceleration of
wheel b y linkage t o the visual principle o f mobile lineality, the
wheel acquired a n e w degree o f intensity. T h e bicycle l i f t e d
the wheel onto the plane of aerodynamic balance, and n o t too i n directly created the airplane. I t was no accident that the W r i g h t
brothers were bicycle mechanics, or that early airplanes seemed
i n some ways like bicycles. T h e transformations o f technology
have the character o f organic evolution because all technologies
are extensions o f our physical being. Samuel Butler raised great
admiration i n Bernard Shaw b y his insight that the evolutionary
process had been fantastically accelerated b y transference t o the
machine mode. Shaw, however, was happy t o leave the matter

in this d e l i g h t f u l l y opaque state. Butler, himself, had at least i n dicated that machines w e r e given vicarious powers o f reproduction
b y their subsequent impact u p o n the v e r y bodies that had b r o u g h t
t h e m i n t o being b y extension. Response t o the increased p o w e r
and speed o f our o w n extended bodies is one w h i c h engenders
n e w extensions. E v e r y technology creates n e w stresses and needs
i n the humlan beings w h o have engendered i t . T h e n e w need and
the n e w technological response are b o r n o f our embrace o f the
already existing technology—a ceaseless process.
Those familiar w i t h the novels and plays o f Samuel Beckett
need n o t be reminded o f the r i c h c l o w n i n g he engenders b y means
o f the bicycle. I t is f o r h i m the prime s y m b o l o f the Cartesian
m i n d i n its acrobatic relation o f m i n d and b o d y i n precarious i m balance. T h i s plight goes w i t h a lineal progression that mimics the
v e r y f o r m o f purposeful and resourceful independence o f action.
F o r Beckett, the integral being is n o t the acrobat b u t the c l o w n .
T h e acrobat acts as a specialist, using o n l y a l i m i t e d segment o f
his faculties. T h e c l o w n is the integral man w h o mimes the
acrobat i n an elaborate drama o f incompetence. Beckett sees the
b i c y c l e as the sign and s y m b o l o f specialist f u t i l i t y i n the present
electric age, w h e n w e must all interact and react, using all o f our
faculties at once.
H u m p t y - D u m p t y is the familiar example o f the c l o w n u n successfully i m i t a t i n g the acrobat. Just because all the King's
horses and all the K i n g ' s men couldn't p u t H u m p t y - D u m p t y
together again, i t doesn't f o l l o w that electromagnetic automation
c o u l d n ' t have p u t H u m p t y - D u m p t y back together. T h e integral
and unified egg had no business sitting o n a w a l l , a n y w a y . W a l l s

beings like eggs. H u m p t y - D u m p t y met the challenge o f the w a l l
w i t h a spectacular collapse.
T h e same nursery r h y m e comments o n the consequences o f
the f a l l o f H u m p t y - D u m p t y . T h a t is the p o i n t about the King's
horses and men. T h e y , t o o , are fragmented and specialized. H a v i n g n o unified vision o f the w h o l e , t h e y are helpless. H u m p t y D u m p t y is an obvious example o f integral wholeness. T h e mere

existence o f the w a l l already spelt his fall. James Joyce i n Fin¬
negans Wake never ceases t o interlace these themes, and the title
o f the w o r k indicates his awareness that "a-stone-aging" as i t may
be, the electric age is recovering the u n i t y of plastic and iconic
space, and is p u t t i n g H u m p t y - D u m p t y back together again.
T h e potter's wheel, like all other technologies, was the acceleration o f an existing process. A f t e r nomad food-gathering
had shifted to sedentary p l o w i n g and seeding, the need f o r storage
increased. Pots were needed f o r m o r e and more purposes. M e n
turned their powers t o changing the forms of things b y cultivat i o n . Change t o special p r o d u c t i o n i n local areas created the need
f o r exchange and f o r transport. F o r this purpose sledges were used
i n N o r t h e r n Europe before 5000 B . C . , and human porters and packbearing animals preceded sledges naturally. T h e wheel under the
sledge was an accelerator of feet, n o t o f hand. W i t h this accelerat i o n of the feet came the need f o r road, just as w i t h the extension
of our backsides i n the f o r m o f chair, came the need f o r table.
T h e wheel is an ablative absolute of feet, as chair is the ablative
absolute of backside. B u t w h e n such ablatives intrude, t h e y alter the
syntax o f society. T h e r e is no ceteris paribus i n the w o r l d o f media
and technology. E v e r y extension or acceleration effects n e w configurations i n the over-all situation at once.
T h e wheel made the road, and moved produce faster f r o m
fields to settlements. Acceleration created larger and larger centers, more and more specialism, and more intense incentives, aggregates, and aggressions. So i t is that the wheeled vehicle makes its
appearance at once as a w a r chariot, just as the urban center,
created b y the wheel, makes its appearance as an aggressive
stronghold. N o f u r t h e r m o t i v a t i o n than the c o m p o u n d i n g and
consolidating o f specialist skills b y acceleration o f the wheel is
needed to explain the m o u n t i n g degree o f human creativity and
destructiveness.
Lewis M u m f o r d calls this urbanization " i m p l o s i o n , " b u t i t
was really an explosion. Cities w e r e made b y the fragmenting
o f pastoral modes. T h e wheel and the road expressed and advanced
this explosion b y a radiational or center-margin pattern. Centralism depends on margins that are accessible b y road and wheel.

M a r i t i m e power does n o t assume this center-margin structure,
and neither do desert and steppe cultures. T o d a y w i t h jet and
electricity, urban centralism and specialism reverse i n t o decentralism and interplay o f social functions i n ever more nonspecialist
forms.
T h e wheel and the road are centralizers because t h e y accelerate u p to a p o i n t that ships cannot. B u t acceleration beyond
a certain point, w h e n i t occurs b y means o f the automobile and the
plane, creates decentralism i n the midst o f the older centralism.
T h i s is the origin o f the urban chaos o f our time. T h e wheel,
pushed beyond a certain intensity of movement, no longer centralizes. A l l electric forms whatsoever have a decentralizing effect, c u t t i n g across the older mechanical patterns like a bagpipe
i n a symphony. I t is too bad that M r . M u m f o r d has chosen the
t e r m " i m p l o s i o n " f o r the urban specialist explosion. " I m p l o s i o n "
belongs t o the electronic age, as i t belonged t o the prehistoric
cultures. A l l p r i m i t i v e societies are implosive, like the spoken
w o r d . B u t "technology is explicitness," as L y m a n Bryson has said;
and explicitness, or specialist extension o f functions, is centralism
and explosion of functions, and not implosion, contraction or
simultaneity.
A n airline executive w h o is m u c h aware of the implosive
character o f w o r l d aviation asked a corresponding executive of
each airline i n the w o r l d t o send h i m a pebble f r o m outside his
office. H i s idea was t o b u i l d a little cairn o f pebbles f r o m all
parts o f the w o r l d . W h e n asked, "So w h a t ? " he said that i n one
spot one could t o u c h every part o f the w o r l d because o f aviation.
I n effect, he had h i t u p o n the mosaic or iconic principle o f
simultaneous t o u c h and interplay that is inherent i n the implosive
speed o f the airplane. T h e same principle o f implosive mosaic is
even more characteristic o f electric i n f o r m a t i o n movement of all
kinds.
Centralism and extension of power b y wheel and w r i t t e n
w o r d t o the margins o f empire are creative o f the direct force,
outside and external, t o w h i c h men do n o t necessarily submit their
minds. B u t implosion is the spell and incantation o f the tribe and
the f a m i l y , to w h i c h men readily submit. U n d e r technological

explicitness, even o f the urban centralist structure, some men
managed t o break o u t o f the charmed circle of tribal magic.
M u m f o r d cites the w o r d s of the Chinese philosopher Mencius
as a comment o n this situation:
W h e n men are subdued by force they do not submit in their
minds, but only because their strength is inadequate. W h e n
men are subdued by power i n personality they are pleased to
their very heart's core and do really submit.
A s the expression o f n e w specialist extensions o f our bodies
the congregating o f people and supplies i n centers b y wheel and
road called f o r endless reciprocal expansion i n a spongelike
action of intake and o u t p u t , w h i c h has entrapped all u r b a n structures everywhere i n place and time. M u m f o r d observes: " I f I
interpret the evidence correctly, the cooperative forms o f urban
p o l i t y were undermined and vitiated f r o m the outset b y the
destructive death-oriented m y t h s w h i c h attended . . . the exorbitant expansion o f physical p o w e r and technological adroitness."
T o have such p o w e r b y extension o f their o w n bodies, men must
explode the inner u n i t y o f their beings i n t o explicit fragments.
T o d a y , i n an age o f implosion, w e are p l a y i n g the ancient explosion backward, as o n a f i l m . W e can w a t c h the pieces o f man's
being c o m i n g together again i n an age that has so m u c h p o w e r that
the all-destructive use o f i t appears meaningless, even t o the d i m
and skew o f w i t .
Historians see the forms o f the great cities i n the ancient
w o r l d as manifesting all facets o f human personality. Institutions,
architectural and administrative, as extensions o f o u r physical
beings necessarily tend t o w a r d w o r l d - w i d e similarities. T h e cent r a l nervous system o f the c i t y was the citadel w h i c h included the
great temple and palace o f the k i n g , invested w i t h the dimensions
and iconography o f p o w e r and prestige. T h e extent t o w h i c h this

A photograph o f "St. Peter's at a M o m e n t
of H i s t o r y " was the cover feature o f Life
magazine f o r June 14, 1963. I t is one of the
peculiar characteristics o f the photo that
i t isolates single moments i n time. T h e T V
camera does not. T h e continuous scanning action o f the T V camera provides,
n o t the isolated moment or aspect, b u t the
contour, the iconic profile and the transparency. E g y p t i a n art, like p r i m i t i v e
sculpture today, provided the significant
outline that had n o t h i n g t o do w i t h a
moment i n time. Sculpture tends t o w a r d
the timeless.
Awareness o f the transforming power
o f the photo is o f t e n embodied i n popular
stories like the one about the admiring
friend w h o said, " M y , that's a fine child
y o u have t h e r e ! " M o t h e r : " O h , that's
nothing. Y o u should see his photograph."
T h e power o f the camera t o be everywhere and t o interrelate things is w e l l i n dicated i n the Vogue
magazine boast

The

( M a r c h 15, 1953): " A w o m a n n o w , and w i t h o u t having t o leave
the c o u n t r y , can have the best o f five ( o r more) nations hanging
i n her closet—beautiful and compatible as a statesman's dream."
T h a t is w h y , i n the photographic age, fashions have come to be
like the collage style i n painting.
A century ago the British craze f o r the monocle gave to the
wearer the power o f the camera t o fix people i n a superior stare,
as i f t h e y were objects. E r i c v o n Stroheim d i d a great job w i t h the
monocle i n creating the haughty Prussian officer. B o t h monocle
and camera tend t o t u r n people i n t o things, and the photograph
extends and multiplies the human image t o the proportions o f
mass-produced merchandise. T h e movie stars and matinee idols are
p u t i n the public domain b y photography. T h e y become dreams
that money can b u y . T h e y can be b o u g h t and hugged and
thumbed more easily than public prostitutes. Mass-produced
merchandise has always made some people uneasy i n its prostitute
aspect. Jean Genet's The Balcony is a play o n this theme o f
society as a brothel environed b y violence and h o r r o r . T h e avid
desire o f mankind t o prostitute itself stands u p against the chaos
o f revolution. T h e brothel remains firm and permanent amidst the
most furious changes. I n a w o r d , photography has inspired Genet
w i t h the theme o f the w o r l d since photography as a B r o t h e l without-Walls.
N o b o d y can c o m m i t photography alone. I t is possible t o have
at least the illusion of reading and w r i t i n g i n isolation, b u t p h o t o g r a p h y does n o t foster such attitudes. I f there is any sense i n
deploring the g r o w t h o f corporate and collective art forms such
as the film and the press, i t is surely i n relation t o the previous
individualist technologies that these new forms corrode. Yet i f
there had been no prints o r woodcuts and engravings, there w o u l d
never have come the photograph. For centuries, the w o o d c u t
and the engraving had delineated the w o r l d b y an arrangement
o f lines and points that had syntax of a v e r y elaborate k i n d . M a n y
historians o f this visual syntax, like E. H . G o m b r i c h and W i l l i a m
M . Ivins, have been at great pains t o explain h o w the art of the
h a n d - w r i t t e n manuscript had permeated the art of the w o o d c u t
and the engraving u n t i l , w i t h the halftone process, the dots and

lines suddenly fell below the threshold o f normal vision. Syntax,
the net o f rationality, disappeared f r o m the later prints, just as i t
tended t o disappear f r o m the telegraph message and f r o m the
impressionist painting. Finally, i n the pointillisme o f Seurat, the
w o r l d suddenly appeared through the painting. T h e direction o f a
syntactical p o i n t o f v i e w f r o m outside onto the painting ended
as literary f o r m d w i n d l e d into headlines w i t h the telegraph. W i t h
the photograph, i n the same w a y , men had discovered h o w t o
make visual reports w i t h o u t syntax.
I t was i n 1839 that W i l l i a m H e n r y Fox T a l b o t read a paper
t o the R o y a l Society w h i c h had as t i t l e : "Some account o f the A r t
of Photogenic D r a w i n g , or the process b y w h i c h N a t u r a l Objects
may be made t o delineate themselves w i t h o u t the aid o f the artist's
pencil." H e was quite aware of photography as a k i n d o f automat i o n that eliminated the syntactical procedures o f pen and pencil.
H e was probably less aware that he had b r o u g h t the pictorial
w o r l d i n t o line w i t h the n e w industrial procedures. F o r p h o t o g raphy m i r r o r e d the external w o r l d automatically, y i e l d i n g an
exactly repeatable visual image. I t was this all-important q u a l i t y
o f u n i f o r m i t y and repeatability that had made the Gutenberg
break between the M i d d l e Ages and the Renaissance. Photography
was almost as decisive i n m a k i n g the break between mere mechanical industrialism and the graphic age of electronic man. T h e
step f r o m the age o f T y p o g r a p h i c M a n t o the age o f Graphic
M a n was taken w i t h the i n v e n t i o n o f photography. B o t h daguerrotypes and photographs i n t r o d u c e d l i g h t and chemistry i n t o
the making process. N a t u r a l objects delineated themselves b y an
exposure intensified b y lens and fixed b y chemicals. I n the daguerreotype process there was the same stippling or p i t t i n g w i t h
minute dots that was echoed later i n Seurat's pointillisme, and is
still continued i n the newspaper mesh o f dots that is called " w i r e p h o t o . " W i t h i n a year o f Daguerre's discovery, Samuel F. B.

obscura, or pictures i n " t h e little dark r o o m , " as the Italians had
named the picture play-box o f the sixteenth century. Just at the
time w h e n mechanical w r i t i n g had been achieved b y movable
types, there g r e w u p the pastime of l o o k i n g at m o v i n g images on
the w a l l o f a dark r o o m . I f there is sunshine outside and a pinhole
i n one w a l l , then the images o f the outer w o r l d w i l l appear o n the
w a l l opposite. T h i s n e w discovery was v e r y exciting t o painters,
since i t intensified the n e w illusion o f perspective and o f the
t h i r d dimension that is so closely related t o the printed w o r d . B u t
the early spectators o f the m o v i n g image i n the sixteenth c e n t u r y
saw those images upside d o w n . For this reason the lens was i n troduced—in order t o t u r n the picture r i g h t side u p . O u r n o r m a l
vision is also upside d o w n . Psychically, w e learn t o t u r n our visual
w o r l d r i g h t side u p b y translating the retinal impression f r o m
visual i n t o tactile and kinetic terms. R i g h t side u p is apparently
something w e feel b u t cannot see d i r e c t l y .
T o the student o f media, the fact that " n o r m a l " right-side-up
vision is a translation f r o m one sense i n t o another is a helpful h i n t
about the kinds o f a c t i v i t y o f distortion and translation that any
language or culture induces i n all o f us. N o t h i n g amuses the
Eskimo more than f o r the w h i t e man t o crane his neck t o see the
magazine pictures stuck o n the igloo walls. F o r the Eskimo no
more needs t o l o o k at a picture r i g h t side u p than does a c h i l d
before he has learned his letters on a line. Just w h y Westerners
should be disturbed t o f i n d that natives have t o learn t o read
pictures, as w e learn t o read letters, is w o r t h consideration. T h e
extreme bias and distortion o f our sense-lives b y our technology
w o u l d seem t o be a fact that w e prefer t o ignore i n our daily lives.
Evidence that natives do n o t perceive i n perspective or sense the
t h i r d dimension seems t o threaten the W e s t e r n ego-image and
structure, as many have f o u n d after a t r i p t h r o u g h the Ames

about the unconscious, is a question w e l l w o r t h investigation.
People are nowadays m u c h concerned t o set their houses i n order,
a process o f self-consciousness that has received large impetus
f r o m photography.
W i l l i a m H e n r y Fox T a l b o t , delighting i n Swiss scenery, began
t o reflect on the camera obscura and w r o t e that " i t was d u r i n g
these thoughts that the idea occurred t o me . . . h o w charming
i t w o u l d be i f i t were possible t o cause these natural images t o i m p r i n t themselves durably, and remain fixed o n paper!" T h e p r i n t i n g press had, i n the Renaissance, inspired a similar desire t o give
permanence t o daily feelings and experience.
T h e method T a l b o t devised was that of p r i n t i n g positives
chemically f r o m negatives, to y i e l d an exactly repeatable image.
T h u s the roadblock that had impeded the Greek botanists and had
defeated their successors was removed. Most of the sciences had
been, f r o m their origins, u t t e r l y handicapped b y the lack o f
adequate nonverbal means of transmitting i n f o r m a t i o n . T o d a y ,

Samples of substances weighing less than a million-billionth

graph has become synonymous w i t h illusion and fantasy, t u r n i n g
society i n t o w h a t Joyce called an "allnights newsery reel," that
substitutes a " r e e l " w o r l d f o r reality. Joyce k n e w more about the
effects o f the photograph o n our senses, our language, and our
t h o u g h t processes than a n y b o d y else. H i s verdict on the " a u t o matic w r i t i n g " that is photography was the abnihilization of the
etym. H e saw the photo as at least a rival, and perhaps a usurper,
o f the w o r d , whether w r i t t e n or spoken. B u t i f etym ( e t y m o l o g y )
means the heart and core and moist substance o f those beings that
w e grasp i n words, then Joyce may w e l l have meant that the
p h o t o was a new creation f r o m n o t h i n g (ab-nihil),
or even a
reduction o f creation t o a photographic negative. I f there is, indeed,
a terrible nihilism i n the photo and a substitution o f shadows f o r
substance, then w e are surely n o t the worse f o r k n o w i n g i t . T h e
technology of the photo is an extension of our o w n being and
can be w i t h d r a w n f r o m circulation like any other technology i f
w e decide that i t is v i r u l e n t . B u t amputation of such extensions
o f our physical being calls f o r as m u c h knowledge and skill as
are prerequisite t o any other physical amputation.
I f the phonetic alphabet was a technical means of severing
the spoken w o r d f r o m its aspects o f sound and gesture, the
photograph and its development i n the movie restored gesture t o
the human technology o f recording experience. I n fact, the
snapshot o f arrested human postures b y photography directed
more attention to physical and psychic posture than ever before.
T h e age o f the photograph has become the age of gesture and
mime and dance, as no other age has ever been. Freud and J u n g
b u i l t their observations o n the interpretation o f the languages o f
b o t h individual and collective postures and gestures w i t h respect
t o dreams and t o the o r d i n a r y acts of everyday life. T h e physical
and psychic gestalts, or " s t i l l " shots, w i t h w h i c h they w o r k e d
were m u c h o w i n g t o the posture w o r l d revealed b y the p h o t o graph. T h e photograph is just as useful f o r collective, as f o r i n d i vidual, postures and gestures, whereas w r i t t e n and printed language is biased t o w a r d the private and individual posture. T h u s ,
the traditional figures o f rhetoric were individual postures o f m i n d

and Jungian archetypes are collective postures o f the m i n d w i t h
w h i c h the w r i t t e n f o r m could n o t cope, any more than i t c o u l d
command mime and gesture. Moreover, that the photograph is
quite versatile i n revealing and arresting posture and structure
wherever i t is used, occurs i n countless examples, such as the
analysis o f b i r d - f l i g h t . I t was the photograph that revealed the
secret o f b i r d - f l i g h t and enabled man t o take off. T h e photo, i n
arresting b i r d - f l i g h t , showed that i t was based o n a principle o f
w i n g fixity. W i n g movement was seen t o be f o r propulsion, n o t
f o r flight.
Perhaps the great revolution produced b y photograph was
i n the traditional arts. T h e painter c o u l d no longer depict a w o r l d
that had been m u c h photographed. H e t u r n e d , instead, t o reveal
the inner process o f creativity i n expressionism and i n abstract art.
Likewise, the novelist could no longer describe objects or happenings f o r readers w h o already k n e w w h a t was happening b y
photo, press, f i l m , and radio. T h e poet and novelist t u r n e d t o those
i n w a r d gestures o f the m i n d b y w h i c h w e achieve insight and b y
w h i c h w e make ourselves and our w o r l d . T h u s art moved f r o m
outer matching t o inner making. Instead o f depicting a w o r l d
that matched the w o r l d w e already k n e w , the artists t u r n e d t o
presenting the creative process f o r public participation. H e has
given t o us n o w the means o f becoming involved i n the m a k i n g process. Each development o f the electric age attracts, and demands, a h i g h degree o f producer-orientation. T h e age o f the c o n sumer o f processed and packaged goods is, therefore, n o t the
present electric age, b u t the mechanical age that preceded i t . Yet,
inevitably, the age o f the mechanical has had t o overlap w i t h the
electric, as i n such obvious instances as the internal combustion
engine that requires the electric spark t o ignite the explosion
that moves its cylinders. T h e telegraph is an electric f o r m that,
w h e n crossed w i t h p r i n t and r o t a r y presses, yields the m o d e r n
newspaper. A n d the photograph is n o t a machine, b u t a chemical
and l i g h t process that, crossed w i t h the machine, yields the movie.
Y e t there is a v i g o r and violence i n these h y b r i d forms that is
self-liquidating, as i t were. For i n radio and T V — p u r e l y electric
forms f r o m w h i c h the mechanical principle has been excluded—

there is an altogether n e w relation o f the m e d i u m t o its users. T h i s
is a relation of high participation and involvement that, f o r good
o r i l l , no mechanism had ever evoked.
Education is ideally c i v i l defense against media fall-out. Y e t
W e s t e r n man has had, so far, no education o r equipment f o r
meeting any of the new media o n their o w n terms. Literate man
is n o t o n l y numb and vague i n the presence o f film or photo, b u t
he intensifies his ineptness b y a defensive arrogance and condescension to " p o p k u l c h " and "mass entertainment." I t was i n this
spirit o f b u l l d o g opacity that the scholastic philosophers failed
to meet the challenge o f the p r i n t e d book i n the sixteenth century.
T h e vested interests o f acquired knowledge and conventional
w i s d o m have always been by-passed and engulfed b y n e w media.
T h e study of this process, however, whether f o r the purpose o f
fixity o r o f change, has scarcely begun. T h e n o t i o n that selfinterest confers a keener eye f o r recognizing and c o n t r o l l i n g the
processes o f change is quite w i t h o u t foundation, as witness the
motorcar industry. H e r e is a w o r l d o f obsolescence as surely
doomed t o s w i f t erosion as was the enterprise o f the b u g g y - and
wagon-makers i n 1915. Y e t does General M o t o r s , f o r example,
k n o w , or even suspect, a n y t h i n g about the effect o f the T V image
o n the users of motorcars? T h e magazine enterprises are similarly
undermined b y the T V image and its effect o n the advertising
icon. T h e meaning o f the n e w ad i c o n has n o t been grasped b y
those w h o stand to lose all. T h e same is t r u e o f the movie industry
i n general. Each o f these enterprises lacks any " l i t e r a c y " i n any
m e d i u m b u t its o w n , and thus the startling changes resulting
f r o m n e w hybrids and crossings o f media catch them unawares.
T o the student o f media structures, every detail o f the total
mosaic o f the contemporary w o r l d is v i v i d w i t h meaningful life.
As early as M a r c h 15, 1953, Vogue magazine announced a new
h y b r i d , resulting f r o m a cross between photograph and air travel:
This first International Fashion Issue of Vogue is to mark
a new point. W e couldn't have done such an issue before.
Fashion only got its internationalization papers a short time
ago, and for the first time i n one issue we can report on
couture collections i n five countries.

T h e advantages o f such ad c o p y as high-grade ore i n the lab
o f the media analyst can be recognized o n l y b y those trained
i n the language o f vision and o f the plastic arts i n general. T h e
c o p y w r i t e r has t o be a strip-tease artist w h o has entire empathy
w i t h the immediate state of m i n d o f the audience. Such, indeed, is
also the aptitude o f the popular novelist or song w r i t e r . I t follows
that any w i d e l y accepted w r i t e r or entertainer embodies and
reveals a current set o f attitudes that can be verbalized b y the
analyst. " D o y o u read me, M a c ? " B u t were the w o r d s of the
Vogue w r i t e r t o be considered merely on literary or editorial
grounds, their meaning w o u l d be missed, just as the c o p y i n a
pictorial ad is n o t to be considered as literary statement b u t as
mime of the psychopathology o f everyday life. I n the age of the
photograph, language takes o n a graphic or iconic character,
whose "meaning" belongs v e r y little t o the semantic universe,
and n o t at all t o the republic of letters.
I f w e open a 1938 c o p y of Life, the pictures or postures then
seen as normal n o w give a sharper sense o f remote time than do
objects o f real antiquity. Small children n o w attach the phrase
"the olden days" t o yesterday's hats and overshoes, so keenly are
they attuned t o the abrupt seasonal changes of visual posture i n
the w o r l d o f fashions. B u t the basic experience here is one that
most people feel f o r yesterday's newspaper, than w h i c h n o t h i n g
could be more drastically out o f fashion. Jazz musicians express
their distaste f o r recorded jazz b y saying, " I t is as stale as yesterday's newspaper."
Perhaps that is the readiest w a y t o grasp the meaning of the
photograph i n creating a w o r l d o f accelerated transience. F o r the
relation w e have t o "today's newspaper," or verbal jazz, is the
same that people feel f o r fashions. Fashion is not a w a y o f being
i n f o r m e d or aware, b u t a w a y o f being with i t . T h a t , however, is
merely t o d r a w attention t o a negative aspect of the photograph.
Positively, the effect of speeding u p temporal sequence is t o
abolish time, m u c h as the telegraph and cable abolished space. O f
course the photograph does b o t h . I t wipes o u t our national f r o n tiers and cultural barriers, and involves us i n The Family of Man,
regardless of any particular p o i n t o f view. A picture o f a group

The

Photograph/191

o f persons of any hue whatever is a picture o f people, not of " c o l ored people." T h a t is the logic of the photograph, politically
speaking. But the logic o f the photograph is neither verbal nor
syntactical, a condition w h i c h renders literary culture quite helpless t o cope w i t h the photograph. B y the same token, the complete
transformation of human sense-awareness b y this f o r m involves a
development o f self-consciousness that alters facial expression and
cosmetic makeup as immediately as i t does our b o d i l y stance, i n
public or i n private. T h i s fact can be gleaned f r o m any magazine
or movie of fifteen years back. I t is n o t too m u c h t o say, therefore, that i f outer posture is affected b y the photograph, so w i t h
our inner postures and the dialogue w i t h ourselves. T h e age o f
Jung and Freud is, above all, the age of the photograph, the age
o f the f u l l gamut of self-critical attitudes.
T h i s immense t i d y i n g - u p o f our inner lives, motivated b y
the n e w picture gestalt culture, has had its obvious parallels i n our
attempts to rearrange our homes and gardens and our cities. T o
see a photograph of the local slum makes the c o n d i t i o n unbearable.
T h e mere matching o f the picture w i t h reality provides a n e w
motive f o r change, as i t does a new motive f o r travel.
Daniel Boorstin i n The Image: or What Happened to the
American
Dream offers a conducted literary t o u r o f the new
photographic w o r l d o f travel. One has merely t o look at the new
tourism i n a literary perspective to discover that i t makes no sense
at all. T o the literary man w h o has read about Europe, i n leisurely
anticipation of a visit, an ad that whispers: " Y o u are just fifteen
gourmet meals f r o m Europe o n the w o r l d ' s fastest ship" is gross
and repugnant. Advertisements of travel b y plane are worse:
" D i n n e r i n N e w Y o r k , indigestion i n Paris." Moreover, the p h o t o graph has reversed the purpose of travel, w h i c h u n t i l n o w had
been to encounter the strange and unfamiliar. Descartes, i n the
early seventeenth century, had observed that traveling was almost
like conversing w i t h men of other centuries, a p o i n t of v i e w quite
u n k n o w n before his time. For those w h o cherish such quaint
experience, i t is necessary today t o go back v e r y many centuries
b y the art and archaeology route. Professor Boorstin seems u n happy that so many Americans travel so m u c h and are changed

b y i t so little. H e feels that the entire travel experience has become
" d i l u t e d , contrived, prefabricated." H e is n o t concerned t o f i n d
o u t w h y the photograph has done this t o us. B u t i n the same w a y
intelligent people i n the past always deplored the w a y i n w h i c h
the book had become a substitute f o r i n q u i r y , conversation, and
reflection, and never troubled t o reflect o n the nature of the
printed book. T h e b o o k reader has always tended t o be passive,
because that is the best w a y t o read. T o d a y , the traveler has
become passive. G i v e n travelers checks, a passport, and a t o o t h brush, the w o r l d is y o u r oyster. T h e macadam road, the railroad,
and the steamship have taken the travail o u t o f travel. People moved
b y the silliest w h i m s n o w clutter the foreign places, because travel
differs v e r y little f r o m going to a movie or t u r n i n g the pages of a
magazine. T h e " G o N o w , Pay L a t e r " f o r m u l a of the travel
agencies m i g h t as w e l l read: " G o n o w , arrive later," f o r i t could
be argued that such people never really leave their beaten paths of
impercipience, nor do they ever arrive at any new place. T h e y
can have Shanghai or Berlin or Venice i n a package t o u r that they
need never open. I n 1961, T W A began t o provide new movies
f o r its trans-Atlantic flights so that y o u could visit Portugal,
California, or anywhere else, w h i l e en route t o H o l l a n d , f o r
example. T h u s the w o r l d itself becomes a sort of museum o f
objects that have been encountered before i n some other medium.
I t is w e l l k n o w n that even museum curators often prefer colored
pictures to the originals of various objects i n their o w n cases. I n
the same w a y , the tourist w h o arrives at the Leaning T o w e r o f
Pisa, or the G r a n d Canyon o f A r i z o n a , can n o w merely check
his reactions t o something w i t h w h i c h he has l o n g been familiar,
and take his o w n pictures o f the same.
T o lament that the packaged t o u r , like the photograph,
cheapens and degrades b y m a k i n g all places easy of access, is t o
miss most o f the game. I t is t o make value judgments w i t h fixed
reference to the fragmentary perspective of literary culture. I t is
the same position that considers a l i t e r a r y landscape as superior t o
a movie travelogue. F o r the untrained awareness, all reading and
all movies, like all travel, are equally banal and unnourishing as
experience. D i f f i c u l t y of access does n o t confer adequacy o f

perception, t h o u g h i t m a y involve an object i n an aura of pseudovalues, as w i t h a gem, a movie star, or an o l d master. T h i s n o w
brings us to the factual core of the "pseudoevent," a label applied
t o the n e w media, i n general, because o f their p o w e r to give n e w
patterns to our lives b y acceleration o f older patterns. I t is necessary t o reflect that this same insidious p o w e r was once felt i n the
old media, including languages. A l l media exist t o invest our lives
w i t h artificial perception and arbitrary values.
A l l meaning alters w i t h acceleration, because all patterns
o f personal and political interdependence change w i t h any acceleration o f i n f o r m a t i o n . Some feel keenly that speed-up has
impoverished the w o r l d t h e y k n e w b y changing its forms o f
human interassociation. T h e r e is n o t h i n g n e w or strange i n a
parochial preference f o r those pseudo-events that happened t o
enter i n t o the composition o f society just before the electric
r e v o l u t i o n o f this century. T h e student o f media soon comes t o
expect the new media o f any period whatever t o be classed as
pseudo b y those w h o have acquired the patterns o f earlier media,
whatever they may happen t o be. T h i s w o u l d seem t o be a normal,
and even amiable, t r a i t ensuring a maximal degree o f social c o n t i n u i t y and permanence amidst change and innovation. B u t all the
conservatism i n the w o r l d does n o t a f f o r d even a token resistance
t o the ecological sweep o f the new electric media. O n a m o v i n g
h i g h w a y the vehicle that backs u p is accelerating i n relation t o the
h i g h w a y situation. Such w o u l d seem to be the ironical status o f
the cultural reactionary. W h e n the t r e n d is one w a y his resistance

Media

One immense area o f photographic influence that affects our
lives is the w o r l d o f packaging and display and, i n general, the
organization of shops and stores o f every k i n d . T h e newspaper
that could advertise every sort o f p r o d u c t o n one page q u i c k l y
gave rise t o department stores that p r o v i d e d every k i n d o f p r o d u c t under one r o o f . T o d a y the decentralizing of such institutions
into a m u l t i p l i c i t y o f small shops i n shopping plazas is p a r t l y the
creation of the car, p a r t l y the result o f T V . B u t the photograph
still exerts some centralist pressure i n the mail-order catalogue.
Y e t the mail-order houses originally felt n o t o n l y the centralist
forces of r a i l w a y and postal services, b u t also, and at the same time,
the decentralizing power of the telegraph. T h e Sears Roebuck
enterprise was d i r e c t l y o w i n g t o stationmaster use o f the telegraph. These men saw that the waste o f goods on r a i l w a y sidings
could be ended b y the speed o f the telegraph t o reroute and concentrate.
T h e complex n e t w o r k of media, other than the photograph
that appears i n the w o r l d of merchandising, is easier t o observe
i n the w o r l d o f sports. I n one instance, the press camera contributed to radical changes i n the game o f football. A press photo
o f battered players i n a 1905 game between Pennsylvania and
Swarthmore came t o the attention o f President T e d d y Roosevelt.
H e was so angered at the picture o f Swarthmore's mangled Bob
M a x w e l l that he issued an immediate ultimatum—that i f r o u g h
play continued, he w o u l d abolish the game b y executive edict. T h e
effect was the same as that of the h a r r o w i n g telegraph reports
o f Russell f r o m the Crimea, w h i c h created the image and role
o f Florence Nightingale.
N o less drastic was the effect of the press photo coverage of
the lives of the r i c h . "Conspicuous consumption" o w e d less to the
phrase o f Veblen than to the press photographer, w h o began t o
invade the entertainment spots of the v e r y r i c h . T h e sights of men
ordering drinks f r o m horseback at the bars o f clubs q u i c k l y caused
a public revulsion that drove the r i c h i n t o the ways o f t i m i d
m e d i o c r i t y and obscurity i n America, w h i c h they have never
abandoned. T h e photograph made i t quite unsafe t o come out
and play, f o r i t betrayed such blatant dimensions of p o w e r as t o

The

be self-defeating. O n the other hand, the movie phase of p h o t o g r a p h y created a new aristocracy o f actors and actresses, w h o
dramatized, on and off the screen, the fantasia o f conspicuous
consumption that the r i c h could never achieve. T h e movie
demonstrated the magic power o f the photo b y p r o v i d i n g a consumer package o f plutocratic dimension f o r all the Cinderellas i n
the w o r l d .
The Gutenberg
Galaxy provides the necessary background
f o r s t u d y i n g the rapid rise o f new visual values after the advent o f
p r i n t i n g f r o m movable types. " A place f o r everything and everyt h i n g i n its place" is a feature n o t o n l y o f the compositor's arrangement of his type fonts, b u t of the entire range of human
organization of knowledge and action f r o m the sixteenth c e n t u r y
o n w a r d . Even the inner life o f the feelings and emotions began
t o be structured and ordered and analyzed according t o separate
pictorial landscapes, as Christopher Hussey explained i n his
fascinating study o f The Picturesque.
M o r e than a century o f
this pictorial analysis of the inner life preceded Talbot's 1839
discovery o f photography. Photography, b y c a r r y i n g the pictorial
delineation of natural objects m u c h f u r t h e r than paint or language
could do, had a reverse effect. B y c o n f e r r i n g a means o f selfdelineation of objects, o f "statement w i t h o u t syntax," p h o t o g r a p h y gave the impetus to a delineation o f the inner w o r l d . Statement w i t h o u t syntax or verbalization was really statement b y gesture, b y mime, and b y gestalt. T h i s new dimension opened f o r
human inspection b y poets like Baudelaire and Rimbaud le paysage
intérieur, or the countries o f the m i n d . Poets and painters invaded
this inner landscape w o r l d l o n g before Freud and Jung b r o u g h t
their cameras and notebooks t o capture states of m i n d . Perhaps
most spectacular of all was Claude Bernard, whose
Introduction
to the Study of Experimental
Medicine
ushered science i n t o
le milieu intérieur o f the b o d y exactly at the time w h e n the poets
d i d the same f o r the l i f e o f perception and feeling.
I t is important t o note that this ultimate stage o f pictorializat i o n was a reversal o f pattern. T h e w o r l d o f b o d y and m i n d
observed b y Baudelaire and Bernard was n o t photographical at
all, b u t a nonvisual set o f relations such as the physicist, f o r

202/Understanding

example, had encountered b y means o f the new mathematics and
statistics. T h e photograph m i g h t be said, also, t o have b r o u g h t t o
human attention the subvisual w o r l d of bacteria that caused Louis
Pasteur t o be d r i v e n f r o m the medical profession b y his indignant
colleagues. Just as the painter Samuel Morse had unintentionally
projected himself i n t o the nonvisual w o r l d o f the telegraph, so
the photograph really transcends the pictorial b y capturing the
inner gestures and postures o f b o t h b o d y and m i n d , y i e l d i n g the
n e w w o r l d s of endocrinology and psychopathology.
T o understand the medium o f the photograph is quite i m possible, then, w i t h o u t grasping its relations t o other media, b o t h
o l d and new. F o r media, as extensions o f our physical and nervous
systems, constitute a w o r l d of biochemical interactions that must
ever seek new e q u i l i b r i u m as new extensions occur. I n America,
people can tolerate their images i n m i r r o r or photo, b u t t h e y are
made uncomfortable b y the recorded sound o f their o w n voices.
T h e photo and visual w o r l d s are secure areas o f anesthesia.

dicates any definite point o f view. As the speed o f i n f o r m a t i o n
increases, the tendency is f o r politics t o move away f r o m representation and delegation o f constituents t o w a r d immediate i n volvement o f the entire c o m m u n i t y i n the central acts o f
decision. Slower speeds o f i n f o r m a t i o n make delegation and
representation mandatory. Associated w i t h such delegation are
the points of v i e w of the different sectors of public interest
that are expected t o be p u t f o r w a r d f o r processing and consideration b y the rest o f the c o m m u n i t y . W h e n the electric
speed is i n t r o d u c e d into such a delegated and representational
organization, this obsolescent organization can o n l y be made t o
f u n c t i o n b y a series o f subterfuges and makeshifts. These strike
some observers as base betrayals o f the original aims and purposes
o f the established forms.
T h e massive theme o f the press can be managed o n l y b y
direct contact w i t h the f o r m a l patterns of the medium i n quest i o n . I t is thus necessary t o state at once that " h u m a n interest" is
a technical t e r m meaning that w h i c h happens w h e n multiple
book pages or multiple i n f o r m a t i o n items are arranged i n a mosaic
o n one sheet. T h e b o o k is a private confessional f o r m that provides
a " p o i n t o f v i e w . " T h e press is a g r o u p confessional f o r m that
provides communal participation. I t can " c o l o r " events b y using
them or b y n o t using them at all. B u t i t is the daily communal
exposure of multiple items i n juxtaposition that gives the press its
complex dimension o f human interest.
T h e book f o r m is n o t a communal mosaic or corporate
image b u t a private voice. One o f the unexpected effects o f T V
o n the press has been a great increase i n the popularity o f Time
and Newsweek. Q u i t e inexplicably t o themselves and w i t h o u t any
new effort at subscription, their circulations have mo re than
doubled since T V . These news magazines are preeminently mosaic
i n f o r m , offering n o t w i n d o w s o n the w o r l d like the o l d picture
magazines, b u t presenting corporate images o f society i n action.
Whereas the spectator of a picture magazine is passive, the reader
o f a news magazine becomes m u c h involved i n the making o f
meanings f o r the corporate image. T h u s the T V habit o f involvement i n mosaic image has greatly strengthened the appeal o f these

Press/205
news magazines, b u t at the same time has diminished the appeal
of the older pictorial feature magazines.
B o t h book and newspaper are confessional i n character,
creating the effect o f inside story by their mere f o r m , regardless
o f content. As the book page yields the inside story of the author's
mental adventures, so the press page yields the inside story of the
c o m m u n i t y i n action and interaction. I t is f o r this reason that the
press seems to be p e r f o r m i n g its f u n c t i o n most w h e n revealing
the seamy side. Real news is bad news—bad news about somebody,
or bad news for somebody. I n 1962, w h e n Minneapolis had been
f o r months w i t h o u t a newspaper, the chief of police said: "Sure,
I miss the news, b u t so far as m y job goes I hope the papers
never come back. T h e r e is less crime around w i t h o u t a newspaper
to pass around the ideas."
Even before the telegraph speed-up, the newspaper of the
nineteenth century had moved a l o n g w a y t o w a r d a mosaic f o r m .
R o t a r y steam presses came i n t o use decades before electricity,
b u t typesetting b y hand remained more satisfactory than any
mechanical means u n t i l the development o f l i n o t y p e about 1890.
W i t h linotype, the press c o u l d adjust its f o r m more f u l l y to the
news-gathering of the telegraph and the n e w s - p r i n t i n g of the
r o t a r y presses. I t is t y p i c a l and significant that the linotype answer
t o the long-standing slowness o f typesetting d i d n o t come f r o m
those d i r e c t l y engaged w i t h the p r o b l e m . Fortunes had been
vainly spent o n typesetting machines before James Clephane,
seeking a fast w a y o f w r i t i n g o u t and duplicating shorthand
notes, f o u n d a w a y t o combine the t y p e w r i t e r and the typesetter.
I t was the typewriter
that solved the u t t e r l y different typesetting

I asked h i m whether he had considered newspaper reading as a
f o r m o f paid employment. I was n o t w r o n g i n supposing that he
w o u l d be incredulous. Nevertheless, all media that m i x ads w i t h
other p r o g r a m m i n g are a f o r m of " p a i d learning." I n years t o

One reason that i t was difficult t o see this fact earlier is that the

business of a mechanical and industrial w o r l d . I t is, however, easily
the dominant business and means o f w e a l t h i n the electric w o r l d .
A t the end o f the mechanical age people still imagined that

press and radio and even T V were merely forms o f i n f o r m a t i o n
paid f o r b y the makers and users of " h a r d w a r e , " like cars and
soap and gasoline. As automation takes h o l d , i t becomes obvious
that information is the crucial c o m m o d i t y , and that solid products

that is, they b u y a piece o f the reader, listener, or viewer as defi n i t e l y as i f they hired our homes f o r a p u b l i c meeting. T h e y

far devised is t o p u t o n a free show. Movies i n America have n o t
developed advertising intervals simply because the movie itself
is the greatest of all forms o f advertisement f o r consumer goods.
Those w h o deplore the f r i v o l i t y o f the press and its natural
f o r m o f group exposure and communal cleansing simply ignore
the nature of the m e d i u m and demand that i t be a book, as i t
tends t o be i n Europe. T h e book arrived i n western Europe l o n g
before the newspaper; b u t Russia and middle Europe developed
the b o o k and newspaper almost together, w i t h the result that t h e y
have never unscrambled the t w o forms. T h e i r journalism exudes
the private p o i n t o f v i e w o f the l i t e r a r y mandarin. British and

monotonous demands o f the l i t e r a r y community—that the newspaper use its mosaic f o r m t o present a fixed p o i n t o f v i e w o n a

T h e editorial, w h i c h is the one book-feature o f the newspaper,
has been ignored f o r m a n y years, unless p u t i n the f o r m o f news
or paid advertisement.
I f our press is i n the main a free entertainment service paid
for b y advertisers w h o w a n t to b u y readers, the Russian press is
in toto the basic mode of industrial p r o m o t i o n . I f w e use news,
political and personal, as entertainment t o capture ad readers, the
Russians use i t as a means o f p r o m o t i o n f o r their economy.
T h e i r political news has the same aggressive earnestness and posture as the voice o f the sponsor i n an A m e r i c a n ad. A culture that
gets the newspaper late ( f o r the same reasons that industrializat i o n is delayed) and one that accepts the press as a f o r m of the
book and regards industry as g r o u p political action, is n o t l i k e l y
t o seek entertainment i n the news. Even i n America, literate
people have small skill i n understanding the iconographic varieties
of the ad w o r l d . A d s are ignored or deplored, b u t seldom studied
and enjoyed.
A n y b o d y w h o could think that the press has the same f u n c t i o n i n America and Russia, or i n France and China, is n o t really

Russians k n o w h o w t o correct the bias of the m e d i u m i n order

state i n the various countries o f the w o r l d k n o w that the newspaper has t o t a l l y diverse effects i n different cultures? T h e r e is
no basis f o r such assumptions. Unawareness of the nature of the
press i n its subliminal or latent action is as c o m m o n among
politicians as among political scientists. For example, i n oral
Russia b o t h Pravda and Izvestia handle domestic news, b u t the
b i g international themes come t o the W e s t over Radio M o s c o w .
I n visual America, radio and television handle the domestic stories,
and international affairs get their f o r m a l treatment i n Time
magazine and The New York Times. As a f o r e i g n service, the
bluntness of Voice of America i n no w a y compares t o the sophistication of the B B C and Radio M o s c o w , b u t w h a t i t lacks i n
verbal content i t makes u p i n the entertainment value of its
American jazz. T h e implications o f this difference o f stress are

Press/209
i m p o r t a n t f o r an understanding of the kinds of opinions and
decisions natural t o an oral, as opposed t o a visual, culture.
A friend of mine w h o tried t o teach something about the
forms o f media i n secondary school was struck b y one unanimous
response. T h e students could n o t f o r a moment accept the
suggestion that the press or any other public means of c o m m u n i cation could be used w i t h base intent. T h e y felt that this
w o u l d be akin to p o l l u t i n g the air or the water supply, and t h e y
d i d n ' t feel that their friends and relatives employed i n these

austere theme w o u l d p u l l up the level of the book, the press, the
movie, and T V . T h e y are w r o n g t o a farcical degree. T h e y have

I f all English were enunciated at a M a n d a r i n level o f u n i f o r m
elegance and sententiousness, w o u l d the language and its users be

T h e book-oriented man has the illusion that the press w o u l d
be better w i t h o u t ads and w i t h o u t the pressure f r o m the advertiser. Reader surveys have astonished even publishers w i t h the
revelation that the r o v i n g eyes o f newspaper readers take equal
satisfaction i n ads and news c o p y . D u r i n g the Second W a r , the

210/ Understanding

Media

U.S.O. sent special issues o f the principal A m e r i c a n magazines
t o the A r m e d Forces, w i t h the ads omitted. T h e men insisted o n
having the ads back again. N a t u r a l l y . T h e ads are b y far the
best part o f any magazine or newspaper. M o r e pains and thought,
more w i t and art go i n t o the m a k i n g o f an ad than i n t o any
prose feature o f press or magazine. A d s are news. W h a t is w r o n g
w i t h them is that t h e y are always good news. I n order t o balance
off the effect and t o sell good news, i t is necessary t o have a l o t
o f bad news. Moreover, the newspaper is a h o t medium. I t has
t o have bad news f o r the sake o f intensity and reader participation.
Real news is bad news, as already noted, and as any newspaper
f r o m the beginning o f p r i n t can testify. Floods, fires, and other
communal disasters b y land and sea and air outrank any k i n d o f
private h o r r o r or villainy as news. A d s , i n contrast, have t o shrill
their happy message l o u d and clear i n order t o m a t c h the penet r a t i n g p o w e r o f bad news.
Commentators o n the press and the A m e r i c a n Senate have
noted that since the Senate began its p r y i n g into unsavory subjects i t has assumed a role superior t o Congress. I n fact, the great
disadvantage o f the Presidency and the Executive a r m i n relation
t o public opinion is that i t tries t o be a source o f g o o d news and
noble directive. O n the other hand, Congressmen and Senators
have the free o f the seamy side so necessary t o the v i t a l i t y o f the
press.
Superficially, this m a y seem cynical, especially t o those w h o
imagine that the content o f a m e d i u m is a matter o f p o l i c y and
personal preference, and f o r w h o m all corporate media, n o t o n l y
radio and the press b u t ordinary popular speech as w e l l , are
debased forms o f human expression and experience. H e r e I
must repeat that the newspaper, f r o m its beginnings, has tended,
n o t t o the b o o k f o r m , b u t t o the mosaic o r participational f o r m .
W i t h the speed-up o f p r i n t i n g and news-gathering, this mosaic
f o r m has become a dominant aspect o f human association; f o r the
mosaic f o r m means, n o t a detached " p o i n t o f v i e w , " b u t participat i o n i n process. F o r that reason, the press is inseparable f r o m the
democratic process, b u t quite expendable f r o m a literary or b o o k
point o f view.

Press/211
A g a i n , the book-oriented man misunderstands the collective
mosaic f o r m o f the press w h e n he complains about its endless
reports o n the seamy underside of the social garment. B o t h b o o k
and press are, i n their v e r y format, dedicated to the job of
revealing the inside story, whether i t is Montaigne g i v i n g t o the
private reader the delicate contours of his m i n d , or Hearst and
W h i t m a n resonating their barbaric yawps over the roofs of the
w o r l d . I t is the printed f o r m of public address and high intensity
w i t h its precise u n i f o r m i t y o f repetition that gives t o book and
press alike the special character of public confessional.
T h e first items i n the press to w h i c h all men t u r n are the
ones about w h i c h t h e y already k n o w . I f w e have witnessed some
event, whether a ball game or a stock crash or a snowstorm, w e
t u r n t o the report o f that happening, first. W h y ? T h e answer is
central t o any understanding o f media. W h y does a child like t o
chatter about the events o f its day, however jerkily? W h y do w e
prefer novels and movies about familiar scenes and characters?
Because f o r rational beings t o see or re-cognize their experience
i n a n e w material f o r m is an unbought grace o f life. Experience
translated into a n e w m e d i u m literally bestows a delightful p l a y back o f earlier awareness. T h e press repeats the excitement w e
have i n using our w i t s , and b y using our w i t s w e can translate
the outer w o r l d into the fabric of our o w n beings. T h i s excitement o f translation explains w h y people quite naturally w i s h
t o use their senses all the time. Those external extensions of sense
and f a c u l t y that w e call media w e use as constantly as w e do
our eyes and ears, and f r o m the same motives. O n the other hand,
the book-oriented man considers this nonstop use of media as
debased; i t is unfamiliar t o h i m i n the b o o k - w o r l d .
U p t o this p o i n t w e have discussed the press as a mosaic
successor t o the b o o k - f o r m . T h e mosaic is the mode of the corporate or collective image and commands deep participation.
T h i s participation is communal rather than private, inclusive
rather than exclusive. F u r t h e r features o f its f o r m can best be
grasped b y a f e w random views taken f r o m outside the present
f o r m o f the press. H i s t o r i c a l l y , f o r example, newspapers had
waited f o r news to come t o them. T h e first A m e r i c a n newspaper,

212/Understanding

Media

issued i n Boston b y Benjamin H a r r i s o n September 25, 1690,
announced that i t was t o be "furnished once a m o n t h ( o r i f any
G l u t of Occurrences happen, o f t e n e r ) . " N o t h i n g c o u l d more
plainly indicate the idea that news was something outside and
beyond the newspaper. U n d e r such r u d i m e n t a r y conditions of
awareness, a principal f u n c t i o n o f the newspaper was t o correct
rumors and oral reports, as a dictionary m i g h t provide " c o r r e c t "
spellings and meanings f o r words that had l o n g existed w i t h o u t
the benefit of dictionaries. F a i r l y soon the press began t o sense
that news was n o t o n l y to be reported b u t also gathered, and,
indeed, t o be made. W h a t w e n t into the press was news. T h e
rest was n o t news. " H e made the news" is a strangely ambiguous
phrase, since t o be i n the newspaper is b o t h t o be news and t o
make news. T h u s " m a k i n g the news," l i k e " m a k i n g g o o d , " implies
a w o r l d o f actions and fictions alike. B u t the press is a daily
action and fiction or t h i n g made, and i t is made o u t of just about
everything i n the c o m m u n i t y . B y the mosaic means, i t is made
i n t o a communal image or cross-section.
W h e n a conventional critic like Daniel Boorstin complains
that modern g h o s t - w r i t i n g , teletype, and w i r e services create an
insubstantial w o r l d of "pseudo-events," he declares, i n effect,
that he has never examined the nature o f any m e d i u m p r i o r t o
those of the electric age. For the pseudo or fictitious character
has always permeated the media, n o t just those of recent origin.
L o n g before b i g business and corporations became aware o f
the image of their operation as a fiction t o be carefully tattooed
u p o n the public sensorium, the press had created the image of the
c o m m u n i t y as a series of on-going actions unified b y datelines.
A p a r t f r o m the vernacular used, the dateline is the o n l y organizing
principle o f the newspaper image o f the c o m m u n i t y . T a k e off the
dateline, and one day's paper is the same as the next. Y e t t o read a
week-old newspaper w i t h o u t n o t i c i n g that i t is not today's is a disconcerting experience. As soon as the press recognized that news
presentation was n o t a repetition o f occurrences and reports b u t
a direct cause o f events, many things began to happen. Advertising
and p r o m o t i o n , u n t i l then restricted, broke onto the f r o n t page,

Press/213
w i t h the aid of Barnum, as sensational stories. Today's press agent
regards the newspaper as a ventriloquist does his d u m m y . H e
can make i t say w h a t he wants. H e looks o n i t as a painter does
his palette and tubes of pigment; f r o m the endless resources o f
available events, an endless variety of managed mosaic effects
can be attained. A n y private client can be ensconced i n a w i d e
range of different patterns and tones of public affairs or human
interest and depth items.
I f w e pay careful attention to the fact that the press is a
mosaic, participant k i n d or organization and a do-it-yourself
k i n d o f w o r l d , w e can see w h y i t is so necessary to democratic
government. T h r o u g h o u t his study of the press i n The
Fourth
Branch of Government, Douglas Cater is baffled b y the fact that
amidst the extreme fragmentation o f government departments
and branches, the press somehow manages t o keep them i n relat i o n t o each other and t o the nation. H e emphasizes the paradox
that the press is dedicated t o the process o f cleansing b y p u b l i c i t y ,
and y e t that, i n the electronic w o r l d o f the seamless web of events,
most affairs must be kept secret. T o p secrecy is translated i n t o
public participation and responsibility b y the magic flexibility o f
the controlled news leak.
I t is b y this k i n d o f ingenious adaptation f r o m day to day
that Western man is beginning to accommodate himself t o the
electric w o r l d of total interdependence. N o w h e r e is this transf o r m i n g process o f adaptation more visible than i n the press. T h e
press, i n itself, presents the contradiction o f an individualistic techn o l o g y dedicated t o shaping and revealing group attitudes.
I t m i g h t be w e l l n o w to observe h o w the press has been
modified b y the recent developments o f telephone, radio, and
T V . W e have seen already that the telegraph is the factor that has
done most t o create the mosaic image of the modern press, w i t h
its mass o f discontinuous and unconnected features. I t is this
group-image o f the communal life, rather than any editorial o u t look or slanting, that constitutes the participant of this medium.
T o the book-man o f detached private culture, this is the scandal
o f the press: its shameless involvement i n the depths of human

214/ Understanding

Media

interest and sentiment. B y eliminating time and space i n news
presentation, the telegraph dimmed the privacy o f the b o o k - f o r m ,
and heightened, instead, the new public image i n the press.
T h e first h a r r o w i n g experience f o r the press man visiting
M o s c o w is the absence o f telephone books. A f u r t h e r h o r r i f y i n g
revelation is the absence of central switchboards i n government
departments. Y o u k n o w the number, or else. T h e student of
media is happy t o read a hundred volumes t o discover t w o facts
such as these. T h e y floodlight a vast m u r k y area o f the pressw o r l d , and illuminate the role of telephone as seen t h r o u g h another
culture. T h e A m e r i c a n newspaperman i n large degree assembles
his stories and processes his data b y telephone because o f the
speed and immediacy of the oral process. O u r popular press is
a near approximation t o the grapevine. T h e Russian and European
newspaperman is, b y comparison, a littérateur. I t is a paradoxical
situation, b u t the press i n literate America has an intensely oral
character, w h i l e i n oral Russia and Europe the press has a strongly
literary character and f u n c t i o n .
T h e English dislike the telephone so m u c h that they substitute
numerous mail deliveries f o r i t . T h e Russians use the telephone
f o r a status symbol, like the alarm clock w o r n b y t r i b a l chiefs
as an article of attire i n A f r i c a . T h e mosaic o f the press image i n
Russia is felt as an immediate f o r m o f tribal u n i t y and participat i o n . Those features o f the press that w e f i n d most discordant
w i t h austere individual standards of l i t e r a r y culture are just the
ones that recommend i t t o the Communist Party. " A newspaper,"
L e n i n once declared, "is n o t o n l y a collective propagandist and
collective agitator; i t is also a collective organizer." Stalin called
i t "the most p o w e r f u l weapon o f our P a r t y . " Khrushchev cites i t
as " o u r chief ideological weapon." These men had more an eye t o
the collective f o r m o f the press mosaic, w i t h its magical power
to impose its o w n assumptions, than t o the p r i n t e d w o r d as
expressing a private p o i n t of v i e w . I n oral Russia, fragmentation
o f government powers is u n k n o w n . N o t f o r them our f u n c t i o n
o f the press as unifier o f fragmented departments. T h e Russian
m o n o l i t h has quite different uses f o r the press mosaic. Russia n o w
needs the press (as w e f o r m e r l y d i d the b o o k ) to translate a tribal

Press/215
and oral c o m m u n i t y i n t o some degree o f visual, u n i f o r m culture
able t o sustain a market system.
I n E g y p t the press is needed to effect nationalism, that visual
k i n d o f u n i t y that springs men out of local and tribal patterns.
Paradoxically, radio has come t o the fore i n E g y p t as the rejuvenator o f the ancient tribes. T h e battery radio carried on the
camel gives to the Bedouin tribes a power and v i t a l i t y u n k n o w n
before, so that t o use the w o r l d "nationalism" f o r the f u r y of oral
agitation that the Arabs have felt b y radio is t o conceal the
situation f r o m ourselves. U n i t y of the Arab-speaking w o r l d can
o n l y come b y the press. Nationalism was u n k n o w n to the Western
w o r l d u n t i l the Renaissance, w h e n Gutenberg made i t possible t o
see the mother tongue i n u n i f o r m dress. Radio does n o t h i n g f o r
this u n i f o r m visual u n i t y so necessary t o nationalism. I n order t o
restrict radio-listening t o national programs, some A r a b governments have passed a l a w f o r b i d d i n g the use of private headphones,
i n effect enforcing a t r i b a l collectivism i n their radio audiences.
Radio restores tribal sensitivity and exclusive involvement i n the
w e b o f kinship. T h e press, o n the other hand, creates a visual, n o t too-involved k i n d o f u n i t y that is hospitable t o the inclusion o f
m a n y tribes, and t o diversity o f private outlook.
I f telegraph shortened the sentence, radio shortened the news
story, and T V injected the interrogative m o o d i n t o journalism.
I n fact, the press is n o w n o t o n l y a telephoto mosaic o f the human
c o m m u n i t y hour b y hour, b u t its technology is also a mosaic o f
all the technologies of the c o m m u n i t y . Even i n its selection o f the
n e w s w o r t h y , the press prefers those persons w h o have already
been accorded some n o t o r i e t y existence i n movies, radio, T V , and
drama. B y this fact, w e can test the nature o f the press medium,
f o r a n y b o d y w h o appears o n l y i n the newspaper is, b y that token,

T h e f o r m a t o f the press—that is, its structural characteristics
—were quite naturally taken over b y the poets after Baudelaire i n
order to evoke an inclusive awareness. O u r ordinary newspaper
page today is n o t o n l y symbolist and surrealist i n an avant-garde
way, b u t i t was the earlier inspiration o f symbolism and surrealism
i n art and poetry, as a n y b o d y can discover b y reading Flaubert or
Rimbaud. Approached as newspaper f o r m , any part o f Joyce's
Ulysses or any poem o f T . S. Eliot's before the Quartets is more
readily enjoyed. Such, however, is the austere c o n t i n u i t y o f book
culture that i t scorns t o notice these liaisons dangereuses among
the media, especially the scandalous affairs o f the book-page w i t h
electronic creatures f r o m the other side o f the linotype.
I n v i e w of the inveterate concern o f the press w i t h cleansing
b y p u b l i c i t y , i t m a y be w e l l t o ask i f i t does n o t set u p an inevitable clash w i t h the medium of the book. T h e press as a collective
and communal image assumes a natural posture o f opposition to
all private manipulation. A n y mere individual w h o begins t o stir
about as i f he were a public something-or-other is g o i n g t o get
i n t o the press. A n y individual w h o manipulates the public f o r
his private good m a y also feel the cleansing power of p u b l i c i t y .
T h e cloak of invisibility, therefore, w o u l d seem t o fall most
naturally o n those w h o o w n newspapers or w h o use them extensively f o r commercial ends. M a y n o t this explain the strange
obsession o f the bookman w i t h the press-lords as essentially corrupt? T h e merely private and fragmentary point of v i e w assumed
b y the book reader and w r i t e r finds natural grounds f o r hostility
t o w a r d the b i g communal power o f the press. As forms, as media,
the book and the newspaper w o u l d seem to be as incompatible
as any t w o media c o u l d be. T h e owners o f media always endeavor
to give the public w h a t i t wants, because they sense that their
power is i n the medium and n o t i n the message or the program.

cured roots of suburbia may s i g n i f y a real change i n A m e r i can orientation. T h e r e is a g r o w i n g uneasiness about the degree t o
w h i c h cars have become the real population o f our cities, w i t h a
resulting loss o f human scale, b o t h i n p o w e r and i n distance. T h e
t o w n planners are p l o t t i n g ways and means t o b u y back our cities
f o r the pedestrian f r o m the b i g transportation interests.
L y n n W h i t e tells the story o f the stirrup and the heavyarmored k n i g h t i n his Medieval Technology
and Social
Change.
So expensive y e t so mandatory was the armored rider f o r shock
combat, that the cooperative feudal system came i n t o existence
to pay f o r his equipment. Renaissance gunpowder and ordnance
ended the m i l i t a r y role o f the k n i g h t and returned the c i t y to the
pedestrian burgess.
I f the motorist is technologically and economically far super i o r t o the armored k n i g h t , i t m a y be that electric changes i n
technology are about t o dismount h i m and r e t u r n us t o the
pedestrian scale. " G o i n g t o w o r k " m a y be o n l y a transitory
phase, like " g o i n g shopping." T h e g r o c e r y interests have l o n g
foreseen the possibility o f shopping b y t w o - w a y T V , or videotelephone. W i l l i a m M . Freeman, w r i t i n g f o r The New
York
Times Service (Tuesday, October 15, 1963), reports that there
w i l l certainly be "a decided transition f r o m today's distribution
vehicles. . . . M r s . Customer w i l l be able t o tune i n o n various
stores. H e r credit identification w i l l be picked u p automatically
via television. Items i n f u l l and f a i t h f u l c o l o r i n g w i l l be viewed.
Distance w i l l h o l d no problem, since b y the end o f the century the
consumer w i l l be able t o make direct television connections regardless o f h o w m a n y miles are i n v o l v e d . "
W h a t is w r o n g w i t h all such prophecies is that t h e y assume a
stable f r a m e w o r k o f fact—in this case, the house and the store—
w h i c h is usually the first t o disappear. T h e changing relation
between customer and shopkeeper is as n o t h i n g compared t o the
changing pattern o f w o r k itself, i n an age of automation. I t is
true that going-to and c o m i n g - f r o m w o r k are almost certain to
lose all o f their present character. T h e car as vehicle, i n that
sense, w i l l go the w a y o f the horse. T h e horse has lost its role i n
transportation b u t has made a strong comeback i n entertainment.

Motorcar/219
So w i t h the motorcar. Its f u t u r e does n o t belong i n the area o f
transportation. H a d the i n f a n t automotive industry, i n 1910, seen
fit t o call a conference t o consider the f u t u r e of the horse, the
discussion w o u l d have been concerned t o discover new jobs f o r
the horse and new kinds o f training to extend the usefulness of
the horse. T h e complete r e v o l u t i o n i n transportation and i n
housing and c i t y arrangement w o u l d have been ignored. T h e t u r n
o f our economy t o making and servicing motorcars, and the devot i o n o f m u c h leisure time t o their use o n a vast n e w h i g h w a y
system, w o u l d n o t even have been t h o u g h t of. I n other w o r d s ,
i t is the f r a m e w o r k itself that changes w i t h n e w technology, and
n o t just the picture w i t h i n the frame. Instead o f t h i n k i n g of doing
our shopping b y television, w e should become aware that T V
i n t e r c o m means the end o f shopping itself, and the end o f w o r k
as w e k n o w i t as present. T h e same fallacy besets out t h i n k i n g about
T V and education. W e t h i n k o f T V as an incidental aid, whereas
i n fact i t has already transformed the learning process of the
y o u n g , quite independently o f home and school alike.
I n the 1930s, w h e n millions of comic books were inundating
the y o u n g w i t h gore, n o b o d y seemed t o notice that emotionally
the violence of millions o f cars i n our streets was incomparably
more hysterical than a n y t h i n g that could ever be printed. A l l the
rhinos and hippos and elephants i n the w o r l d , i f gathered i n one
c i t y , c o u l d not begin t o create the menace and explosive intensity
o f the h o u r l y and daily experience o f the internal-combustion
engine. A r e people really expected to internalize—live w i t h — a l l
this p o w e r and explosive violence, w i t h o u t processing and sip h o n i n g i t off i n t o some f o r m of fantasy f o r compensation and
balance?
I n the silent pictures o f the 1920s a great many o f the
sequences involved the motorcar and policemen. Since the film
was then accepted as an optical illusion, the cop was the principal
reminder o f the existence o f g r o u n d rules i n the game of fantasy.
A s such, he t o o k an endless beating. T h e motorcars o f the 1920s
l o o k t o our eyes like ingenious contraptions hastily assembled i n
a t o o l shop. T h e i r l i n k w i t h the b u g g y was still strong and clear.
T h e n came the balloon tires, the massive interior, and the b u l g i n g

fenders. Some people see the b i g car as a sort o f bloated middle age,
f o l l o w i n g the g a w k y period of the first love-affair between
A m e r i c a and the car. B u t f u n n y as the Viennese analysts have been
able t o get about the car as sex object, t h e y have at last, i n so
doing, d r a w n attention t o the fact that, like the bees i n the plant
w o r l d , men have always been the sex organs o f the technological
w o r l d . T h e car is no more and no less a sex object than the wheel
o r the hammer. W h a t the m o t i v a t i o n researchers have missed
entirely is the fact that the A m e r i c a n sense o f spatial f o r m has
changed m u c h since radio, and drastically since T V . I t is misleading, t h o u g h harmless, t o t r y t o grasp this change as middle-age
reaching out f o r the sylph L o l i t a .
Certainly there have been some strenuous slimming programs
f o r the car i n recent years. B u t i f one were t o ask, " W i l l the
car last?" or "Is the motorcar here t o stay?" there w o u l d be confusion and doubt at once. Strangely, i n so progressive an age,
w h e n change has become the o n l y constant i n our lives, w e never
ask, "Is the car here t o stay?" T h e answer, o f course, is " N o . "
I n the electric age, the wheel itself is obsolescent. A t the heart
o f the car industry there are men w h o k n o w that the car is passing,
as certainly as the cuspidor was doomed w h e n the l a d y typist
arrived o n the business scene. W h a t arrangements have they made
t o ease the automobile i n d u s t r y off the center o f the stage? T h e
mere obsolescence o f the wheel does n o t mean its disappearance.
I t means o n l y that, like penmanship or t y p o g r a p h y , the wheel w i l l
move into a subsidiary role i n the culture.
I n the middle o f the nineteenth century great success was
achieved w i t h steam-engined cars o n the open road. O n l y the
heavy toll-taxes levied b y local road authorities discouraged steam
engines on the highways. Pneumatic tires were fitted t o a steam
car i n France i n 1887. T h e A m e r i c a n Stanley Steamer began t o
flourish i n 1899. F o r d had already b u i l t his first car i n 1896, and
the F o r d M o t o r Company was founded i n 1903. I t was the electric
spark that enabled the gasoline engine t o take over f r o m the steam
engine. T h e crossing of electricity, the biological f o r m , w i t h the
mechanical f o r m was never to release a greater force.
I t is T V that has dealt the heavy b l o w t o the A m e r i c a n car.

Motorcar/22]
T h e car and the assembly line had become the ultimate expression
o f Gutenberg technology; that is, o f u n i f o r m and repeatable p r o c esses applied t o all aspects o f w o r k and l i v i n g . T V b r o u g h t a
questioning of all mechanical assumptions about u n i f o r m i t y and
standardization, as of all consumer values. T V b r o u g h t also obsession w i t h depth study and analysis. M o t i v a t i o n research,
o f f e r i n g t o hook the ad and the id, became immediately acceptable
t o the frantic executive w o r l d that felt the same w a y about the
n e w A m e r i c a n tastes as A l Capp d i d about his 50,000,000 audience
w h e n T V struck. Something had happened. America was not the
same.
F o r f o r t y years the car had been the great leveler o f physical
space and o f social distance as w e l l . T h e talk about the A m e r i c a n
car as a status symbol has always overlooked the basic fact that
i t is the power of the motorcar that levels all social differences,
and makes the pedestrian a second-class citizen. M a n y people have
observed h o w the real integrator or leveler o f w h i t e and N e g r o
i n the South was the private car and the t r u c k , n o t the expression
o f m o r a l points of v i e w . T h e simple and obvious fact about the
car is that, more than any horse, i t is an extension o f man that
turns the rider i n t o a superman. I t is a hot, explosive medium o f
social communication. A n d T V , b y cooling off the A m e r i c a n
public tastes and creating n e w needs f o r unique w r a p - a r o u n d
space, w h i c h the European car p r o m p t l y provided, practically
unhorsed the A m e r i c a n auto-cavalier. T h e small European cars
reduce h i m to near-pedestrian status once more. Some people
manage t o drive them o n the sidewalk.
T h e car d i d its social leveling b y horsepower alone. I n t u r n ,
the car created highways and resorts that were n o t o n l y v e r y
m u c h alike i n all parts of the land, b u t equally available t o all.
Since T V , there is naturally frequent complaint about this u n i f o r m i t y of vehicle and vacation scene. As J o h n Keats p u t i t i n his
attack o n the car and the i n d u s t r y i n The Insolent Chariots, where
one automobile can go, all other automobiles do go, and wherever
the automobile goes, the automobile version o f civilization surely
follows. N o w this is a T V - o r i e n t e d sentiment that is n o t o n l y a n t i car and anti-standardization, b u t anti-Gutenberg, and therefore

222/Understanding

anti-American as w e l l . O f course, I k n o w that John Keats doesn't
mean this. H e had never thought about media or the w a y i n w h i c h
Gutenberg created H e n r y F o r d and the assembly line and standardized culture. A l l he k n e w was that i t was popular t o decry the
u n i f o r m , the standardized, and the h o t forms of communication,
i n general. For that reason, Vance Packard could make hay w i t h
The Hidden Persuaders. H e hooted at the o l d salesmen and the
h o t media, just as MAD does. Before T V , such gestures w o u l d
have been meaningless. I t w o u l d n ' t have paid off. N o w , i t pays
to laugh at the mechanical and the merely standardized. John
Keats could question the central g l o r y o f classless A m e r i c a n
society b y saying, " I f you've seen one part o f America, y o u ' v e
seen i t a l l , " and that the car gave the A m e r i c a n the o p p o r t u n i t y ,
n o t t o travel and experience adventure, b u t " t o make himself more
and more c o m m o n . " Since T V , i t has become popular to regard
the more and more u n i f o r m and repeatable products o f industry
w i t h the same contempt that a Brahmin like H e n r y James m i g h t
have f e l t f o r a chamber-pot dynasty i n 1890. I t is true that automation is about t o produce the unique and custom-built at assembly-line speed and cheapness. A u t o m a t i o n can manage the
bespoke car or coat w i t h less fuss than w e ever produced the
standardized ones. B u t the unique p r o d u c t cannot circulate i n our
market or distribution setups. As a result, w e are m o v i n g i n t o a
most revolutionary period i n marketing, as i n everything else.

W a r they w o u l d say, " B u t y o u have communism here!" W h a t
t h e y meant was that w e n o t o n l y had standardized goods, b u t
everybody had them. O u r millionaires n o t o n l y ate cornflakes and
hot dogs, b u t really t h o u g h t of themselves as middle-class people.
W h a t else? H o w could a millionaire be anything b u t " m i d d l e class" i n America unless he had the creative imagination o f an
artist t o make a unique life f o r himself? Is i t strange that E u r o peans should associate u n i f o r m i t y o f environment and c o m modities w i t h communism? A n d that L l o y d W a r n e r and his associates, i n their studies of A m e r i c a n cities, should speak of the
A m e r i c a n class system i n terms of income? T h e highest income
cannot liberate a N o r t h American f r o m his "middle-class" life.

Motorcar/223
T h e lowest income gives everybody a considerable piece o f the
same middle-class existence. T h a t is, w e really have homogenized
our schools and factories and cities and entertainment t o a great
extent, just because w e are literate and do accept the logic o f
u n i f o r m i t y and homogeneity that is inherent i n Gutenberg
technology. T h i s logic, w h i c h had never been accepted i n Europe
u n t i l v e r y recently, has suddenly been questioned i n America,
since the tactile mesh o f the T V mosaic has begun t o permeate
the A m e r i c a n sensorium. W h e n a popular w r i t e r can, w i t h c o n fidence, decry the use o f the car f o r travel as m a k i n g the driver
" m o r e and more c o m m o n , " the fabric o f A m e r i c a n life has been
questioned.
O n l y a f e w years back Cadillac announced its " E l Dorado

to be an ideal comic script f o r MAD. T h e script was always there,
i n fact, b u t not t i l l T V was the audience conditioned t o enjoy i t .
T o mistake the car f o r a status symbol, just because i t is
asked t o be taken as a n y t h i n g b u t a car, is to mistake the w h o l e
meaning o f this v e r y late p r o d u c t of the mechanical age that is
n o w y i e l d i n g its f o r m t o electric technology. T h e car is a superb
piece o f u n i f o r m , standardized mechanism that is of a piece w i t h

executives, is n o t a m a r k of the car and mechanical age, b u t o f the
electric forces that are n o w ending this mechanical age o f u n i f o r m i t y and standardization, and recreating the norms o f status
and role.
W h e n the motorcar was new, i t exercised the t y p i c a l mechanical pressure o f explosion and separation o f functions. I t broke
u p f a m i l y life, or so i t seemed, i n the 1920s. I t separated w o r k and
domicile, as never before. I t exploded each c i t y into a dozen
suburbs, and then extended many o f the forms o f urban life
along the highways u n t i l the open road seemed t o become n o n stop cities. I t created the asphalt jungles, and caused 40,000 square
miles o f green and pleasant land t o be cemented over. W i t h the
arrival o f plane travel, the motorcar and t r u c k teamed u p together
t o w r e c k the railways. T o d a y small children plead f o r a t r a i n ride
as i f i t were a stagecoach or horse and cutter: "Before they're
gone, D a d d y . "
T h e motorcar ended the countryside and substituted a new
landscape i n w h i c h the car was a sort o f steeplechaser. A t the same
time, the m o t o r destroyed the c i t y as a casual environment i n
w h i c h families c o u l d be reared. Streets, and even sidewalks, became too intense a scene f o r the casual interplay o f g r o w i n g u p .
A s the c i t y filled w i t h mobile strangers, even next-door neighbors
became strangers. T h i s is the story o f the motorcar, and i t has
n o t m u c h longer t o r u n . T h e tide o f taste and tolerance has turned,
since T V , to make the hot-car m e d i u m increasingly tiresome.
Witness the portent o f the crosswalk, where the small c h i l d has
p o w e r t o stop a cement t r u c k . T h e same change has rendered
the b i g c i t y unbearable to many w h o w o u l d no more have f e l t that
w a y ten years ago than they c o u l d have enjoyed reading MAD.
T h e continuing power o f the car medium t o transform the
patterns of settlement appears f u l l y i n the w a y i n w h i c h the new
urban kitchen has taken o n the same central and m u l t i p l e social
character as the o l d f a r m kitchen. T h e f a r m kitchen had been the
k e y p o i n t of e n t r y t o the farmhouse, and had become the social
center, as w e l l . T h e n e w suburban home again makes the kitchen
the center and, ideally, is localized f o r access to and f r o m the car.
T h e car has become the carapace, the protective and aggressive

Motorcar/22b
shell, o f urban and suburban man. Even before the Volkswagen,
observers above street level have often noticed the near-resemblance o f cars t o shiny-backed insects. I n the age of the tactileoriented skin-diver, this hard shiny carapace is one of the blackest
marks against the motorcar. I t is f o r motorized man that the
shopping plazas have emerged. T h e y are strange islands that make
the pedestrian feel friendless and disembodied. T h e car bugs h i m .
T h e car, i n a w o r d , has quite refashioned all of the spaces
that unite and separate men, and i t w i l l continue to do so f o r a
decade more, b y w h i c h time the electronic successors to the car
w i l l be manifest.

T h e continuous pressure is t o create ads
more and m o r e i n the image o f audience
motives and desires. T h e p r o d u c t matters
less as the audience participation increases.
A n extreme example is the corset series
that protests that " i t is n o t the corset that
y o u feel." T h e need is t o make the ad i n clude the audience experience. T h e p r o d u c t and the public response become a
single complex pattern. T h e art o f advertising has w o n d r o u s l y come t o f u l f i l l the
early definition o f anthropology as "the
science o f man embracing w o m a n . " T h e
steady t r e n d i n advertising is t o manifest
the p r o d u c t as an integral part o f large
social purposes and processes. W i t h v e r y
large budgets the commercial artists have
tended t o develop the ad into an icon, and
icons are n o t specialist fragments or aspects
b u t unified and compressed images o f
complex k i n d . T h e y focus a large region
of experience i n t i n y compass. T h e trend
i n ads, then, is away f r o m the consumer

Ads/121
p i c t u r e o f p r o d u c t to the producer image o f process. T h e corporate image of process includes the consumer i n the producer
role as w e l l .
T h i s p o w e r f u l n e w t r e n d i n ads t o w a r d the iconic image
has greatly weakened the position of the magazine i n d u s t r y i n
general and the picture magazines i n particular. Magazine features
have l o n g employed the pictorial treatment of themes and news.
Side b y side w i t h these magazine features that present shots and
fragmentary points o f v i e w , there are the n e w massive iconic ads
w i t h their compressed images that include producer and consumer,
seller and society i n a single image. T h e ads make the features
seem pale, weak, and anemic. T h e features belong t o the o l d
pictorial w o r l d that preceded T V mosaic imagery.
I t is the p o w e r f u l mosaic and iconic thrust i n our experience
since T V that explains the paradox of the upsurge o f Time and
Newsweek
and similar magazines. These magazines present the
news i n a compressed mosaic f o r m that is a real parallel t o the
ad w o r l d . Mosaic news is neither narrative, n o r p o i n t o f v i e w ,
nor explanation, nor comment. I t is a corporate image i n depth
o f the c o m m u n i t y i n action and invites maximal participation
i n the social process.
A d s seem t o w o r k on the v e r y advanced principle that a small
pellet or pattern i n a noisy, redundant barrage o f repetition w i l l
gradually assert itself. A d s push the principle of noise all the w a y
t o the plateau o f persuasion. T h e y are quite i n accord w i t h the
procedures of brain-washing. T h i s depth principle o f onslaught
o n the unconscious m a y be the reason w h y .
M a n y people have expressed uneasiness about the advertising
enterprise i n our time. T o p u t the matter a b r u p t l y , the advertising
industry is a crude attempt t o extend the principles o f automation
t o every aspect o f society. Ideally, advertising aims at the goal o f
a programmed harmony among all human impulses and aspirations
and endeavors. U s i n g handicraft methods, i t stretches out t o w a r d
the ultimate electronic goal o f a collective consciousness. W h e n
all p r o d u c t i o n and all consumption are b r o u g h t i n t o a preestablished harmony w i t h all desire and all effort, then advertising
w i l l have liquidated itself b y its o w n success.

Since the advent o f T V , the exploitation of the unconscious
b y the advertiser has h i t a snag. T V experience favors m u c h
more consciousness concerning the unconscious than do the hardsell forms of presentation i n the press, the magazine, movie, or
radio. T h e sensory tolerance o f the audience has changed, and
so have the methods of appeal b y the advertisers. I n the new cool
T V w o r l d , the o l d h o t w o r l d of hard-selling, earnest-talking
salesmen has all the antique charm o f the songs and togs of the
1920s. M o r t Sahl and Shelley Berman are merely f o l l o w i n g , n o t
setting, a trend i n spoofing the ad w o r l d . T h e y discovered that
they have o n l y t o reel off an ad or news i t e m t o have the audience
i n fits. W i l l Rogers discovered years ago that any newspaper
read aloud f r o m a theater stage is hilarious. T h e same is t r u e today
o f ads. A n y ad p u t into a n e w setting is f u n n y . T h i s is a w a y
of saying that any ad consciously attended t o is comical. A d s are
n o t meant f o r conscious consumption. T h e y are intended as
subliminal pills f o r the subconscious i n order t o exercise an
h y p n o t i c spell, especially o n sociologists. T h a t is one o f the most
e d i f y i n g aspects o f the huge educational enterprise that w e call
advertising, whose twelve-billion-dollar annual budget approximates the national school budget. A n y expensive ad represents
the t o i l , attention, testing, w i t , art, and skill of many people. Far
more t h o u g h t and care go i n t o the composition o f any prominent
ad i n a newspaper or magazine than go i n t o the w r i t i n g o f their
features and editorials. A n y expensive ad is as carefully b u i l t o n
the tested foundations o f public stereotypes or "sets" o f established
attitudes, as any skyscraper is b u i l t o n bedrock. Since h i g h l y
skilled and perceptive teams o f talent cooperate i n the m a k i n g o f
an ad f o r any established line o f goods whatever, i t is obvious that
any acceptable ad is a vigorous dramatization o f communal experience. N o g r o u p of sociologists can approximate the ad teams
i n the gathering and processing o f exploitable social data. T h e
ad teams have billions to spend annually o n research and testing
of reactions, and their products are magnificent accumulations
of material about the shared experience and feelings o f the entire
c o m m u n i t y . O f course, i f ads w e r e t o depart f r o m the center o f

Ads/229
this shared experience, t h e y w o u l d collapse at once, b y losing
all h o l d o n our feelings.
I t is true, of course, that ads use the most basic and tested
human experience of a c o m m u n i t y i n grotesque ways. T h e y are
as incongruous, i f looked at consciously, as the playing of "Silver
Threads among the G o l d " as music f o r a strip-tease act. B u t ads
are carefully designed b y the Madison Avenue frogmen-of-them i n d f o r semiconscious exposure. T h e i r mere existence is a testim o n y , as w e l l as a c o n t r i b u t i o n , to the somnambulistic state o f
a tired metropolis.
A f t e r the Second W a r , an ad-conscious A m e r i c a n a r m y o f ficer i n I t a l y noted w i t h misgiving that Italians could tell y o u the
names of cabinet ministers, b u t not the names o f commodities
preferred b y Italian celebrities. Furthermore, he said, the w a l l
space o f Italian cities was given over t o political, rather than c o m mercial, slogans. H e predicted that there was small hope that
Italians w o u l d ever achieve any sort of domestic prosperity or
calm u n t i l they began t o w o r r y about the rival claims o f c o r n flakes and cigarettes, rather than the capacities of public men. I n
fact, he w e n t so far as t o say that democratic freedom v e r y
largely consists i n i g n o r i n g politics and w o r r y i n g , instead, about
the threat o f scaly scalp, hairy legs, sluggish bowels, saggy breasts,
receding gums, excess w e i g h t , and tired b l o o d .
T h e a r m y officer was probably r i g h t . A n y c o m m u n i t y that
wants t o expedite and maximize the exchange o f goods and services has simply got to homogenize its social life. T h e decision t o
homogenize comes easily to the h i g h l y literate population of the
English-speaking w o r l d . Y e t i t is hard f o r oral cultures t o agree
o n this program of homogenization, f o r they are o n l y too prone
t o translate the message of radio into tribal politics, rather than
i n t o a n e w means o f pushing Cadillacs. T h i s is one reason that i t
was easy f o r the retribalized N a z i t o feel superior to the A m e r i c a n
consumer. T h e tribal man can spot the gaps i n the literate ment a l i t y v e r y easily. O n the other hand, i t is the special illusion o f
literate societies that they are h i g h l y aware and individualistic.
Centuries o f typographic conditioning i n patterns of lineal u n i -

f o r m i t y and fragmented repeatability have, i n the electric age,
been given increasing critical attention b y the artistic w o r l d .
T h e lineal process has been pushed out o f industry, n o t o n l y i n management and p r o d u c t i o n , b u t i n entertainment, as w e l l . I t is the
new mosaic f o r m o f the T V image that has replaced the G u t e n berg structural assumptions. Reviewers of W i l l i a m Burroughs'
The Naked Lunch
have alluded t o the prominent use of the
"mosaic" t e r m and method i n his novel. T h e T V image renders
the w o r l d of standard brands and consumer goods merely amusi n g . Basically, the reason is that the mosaic mesh of the T V image
compels so m u c h active participation o n the part of the viewer
that he develops a nostalgia f o r pre-consumer ways and days.
Lewis M u m f o r d gets serious attention w h e n he praises the cohesive f o r m of medieval towns as relevant to our time and needs.
Advertising got into high gear o n l y at the end o f the last
century, w i t h the invention of photoengraving. Ads and pictures
then became interchangeable and have continued so. M o r e i m portant, pictures made possible great increases i n newspaper and
magazine circulation that also increased the quantity and p r o f i t ability of ads. T o d a y i t is inconceivable that any publication,
daily or periodical, could hold more than a f e w thousand readers
w i t h o u t pictures. F o r b o t h the pictorial ad or the picture story
provide large quantities of instant i n f o r m a t i o n and instant humans,
such as are necessary f o r keeping abreast i n our k i n d of culture.
W o u l d i t not seem natural and necessary that the y o u n g be p r o vided w i t h at least as m u c h training o f perception i n this graphic
and photographic w o r l d as they get i n the typographic? I n fact,
they need more training i n graphics, because the art o f casting
and arranging actors i n ads is b o t h complex and f o r c e f u l l y insidious.
Some writers have argued that the Graphic Revolution has
shifted our culture away f r o m private ideals t o corporate images.
T h a t is really t o say that the photo and T V seduce us f r o m the
literate and private " p o i n t of v i e w " t o the complex and inclusive
w o r l d of the group icon. T h a t is certainly w h a t advertising does.
Instead o f presenting a private argument or vista, i t offers a w a y

Ads/231
o f l i f e that is f o r everybody or nobody. I t offers this prospect
w i t h arguments that concern o n l y irrelevant and trivial matters.
F o r example, a lush car ad features a baby's rattle o n the r i c h r u g
o f the back floor and says that i t has removed unwanted car
rattles as easily as the user could remove the baby's rattle. T h i s
k i n d o f c o p y has really n o t h i n g to do w i t h rattles. T h e c o p y is
merely a punning gag t o distract the critical faculties w h i l e the
image o f the car goes t o w o r k o n the hypnotized viewer. Those
w h o have spent their lives protesting about "false and misleading
ad c o p y " are godsends t o advertisers, as teetotalers are t o brewers,
and moral censors are t o books and films. T h e protestors are the
best acclaimers and accelerators. Since the advent o f pictures, the
job o f the ad c o p y is as incidental and latent, as the "meaning"
o f a poem is t o a poem, o r the words o f a song are t o a song.
H i g h l y literate people cannot cope w i t h the nonverbal art o f the
pictorial, so they dance impatiently up and d o w n t o express a
pointless disapproval that renders them f u t i l e and gives n e w p o w e r
and a u t h o r i t y to the ads. T h e unconscious depth-messages o f ads
are never attacked b y the literate, because o f their incapacity t o
notice or discuss nonverbal forms o f arrangement and meaning.
T h e y have not the art t o argue w i t h pictures. W h e n early i n T V
broadcasting hidden ads were t r i e d out, the literate were i n a great
panic u n t i l they were dropped. T h e fact that t y p o g r a p h y is itself

that is safe f r o m the book-oriented c o m m u n i t y .
W h e n the movies came, the entire pattern of American l i f e

the image o f the individualist hard-sell salesman and the docile
consumer, just as i t has b l u r r e d the f o r m e r l y clear figures o f the

Games are popular art, collective, social reactions t o the main
drive or action of any culture. Games, like institutions, are extensions o f social man and o f the b o d y politic, as technologies are

are counter-irritants or ways o f adjusting t o the stress o f the
specialized actions that occur i n any social g r o u p . A s extensions
of the popular response t o the w o r k a d a y stress, games become

The traditional enemies of the Willigiman-Wallalua are the
Wittaia, a people exactly like themselves i n language, dress
and custom. . . . Every week or t w o the Willigiman-Wallalua and their enemies arrange a formal battle at one of the
traditional fighting grounds. I n comparison w i t h the catastrophic conflicts of "civilized" nations, these frays seem more
like a dangerous field sport than true war. Each battle lasts
but a single day, always stops before nightfall (because of the
danger of ghosts) or if it begins to rain (no one wants to get
his hair or ornaments w e t ) . The men are very accurate w i t h
their weapons—they have all played war games since they
were small boys—but they are equally adept at dodging, and
hence are rarely hit by anything.
The truly lethal part of this primitive warfare is not
the formal battle but the sneak raid or stealthy ambush i n
which not only men but women and children are mercilessly slaughtered. . . .
This perpetual bloodshed is carried on for none of the usual
reasons for waging war. N o territory is w o n or lost; no goods
or prisoners seized. . . . They fight because they enthusiastically enjoy i t , because i t is to them a vital function of the
complete man, and because they feel they must satisfy the
ghosts of slain companions.
These people, i n short, detect i n these games a k i n d o f model
o f the universe, i n whose deadly gavotte they can participate

Game

s/111

Games are dramatic models of our psychological lives p r o v i d i n g release of particular tensions. T h e y are collective and p o p ular art forms w i t h strict conventions. A n c i e n t and nonliterate
societies naturally regarded games as live dramatic models o f the
universe or of the outer cosmic drama. T h e O l y m p i c games were
direct enactments o f the agon, or struggle o f the Sun god. T h e
runners moved around a track adorned w i t h the zodiacal signs i n
i m i t a t i o n o f the daily c i r c u i t o f the sun chariot. W i t h games and
plays that were dramatic enactments o f a cosmic struggle, the
spectator role was plainly religious. T h e participation i n these
rituals kept the cosmos on the r i g h t track, as w e l l as p r o v i d i n g a
booster shot f o r the tribe. T h e tribe or the c i t y was a d i m replica
o f that cosmos, as m u c h as were the games, the dances, and the
icons. H o w art became a sort o f civilized substitute f o r magical
games and rituals is the story o f the detribalization w h i c h came
w i t h literacy. A r t , like games, became a mimetic echo of, and
relief f r o m , the o l d magic o f total involvement. A s the audience
f o r the magic games and plays became more individualistic, the
role o f art and ritual shifted f r o m the cosmic to the humanly
psychological, as i n Greek drama. Even the ritual became more
verbal and less mimetic o r dancelike. Finally, the verbal narrative
f r o m H o m e r and O v i d became a romantic literary substitute f o r
the corporate l i t u r g y and group participation. M u c h of the schola r l y e f f o r t of the past c e n t u r y i n many fields has been devoted t o
a minute reconstruction of the conditions o f primitive art and
r i t u a l , f o r i t has been f e l t that this course offers the k e y to understanding the m i n d of p r i m i t i v e man. T h e k e y t o this understandi n g , however, is also available i n our new electric technology that
is so s w i f t l y and p r o f o u n d l y re-creating the conditions and a t t i tudes o f primitive t r i b a l man i n ourselves.
T h e w i d e appeal o f the games of recent times—the popular
sports o f baseball and f o o t b a l l and ice hockey—seen as outer
models o f inner psychological life, become understandable. A s
models, they are collective rather than private dramatizations
o f inner life. L i k e our vernacular tongues, all games are media
o f interpersonal communication, and t h e y could have neither
existence nor meaning except as extensions o f o u r immediate

238/Understanding

Media

inner lives. I f w e take a tennis racket i n hand, or thirteen playing
cards, w e consent to being a part o f a dynamic mechanism i n an
artificially contrived situation. Is this n o t the reason w e enjoy
those games most that m i m i c other situations i n our w o r k and
social lives? D o n o t our favorite games provide a release f r o m the
monopolistic t y r a n n y o f the social machine? I n a w o r d , does n o t
Aristotle's idea o f drama as a mimetic reenactment and relief f r o m
our besetting pressures apply perfectly t o all kinds o f games and
dance and fun? F o r f u n or games t o be welcome, t h e y must c o n v e y an echo o f w o r k a d a y life. O n the other hand, a man or
society w i t h o u t games is one sunk i n the zombie trance o f the
automation. A r t and games enable us t o stand aside f r o m the
material pressures o f routine and convention, observing and questioning. Games as popular art forms offer t o all an immediate
means of participation i n the f u l l life o f a society, such as no
single role or job can offer t o any man. Hence the contradiction
i n "professional" sport. W h e n the games door opening into the
free life leads i n t o a merely specialist job, everybody senses an
incongruity.
T h e games o f a people reveal a great deal about them. Games
are a sort o f artificial paradise like Disneyland, or some U t o p i a n
vision b y w h i c h w e interpret and complete the meaning o f our
daily lives. I n games w e devise means o f nonspecialized participat i o n i n the larger drama o f our time. B u t f o r civilized man the
idea of participation is s t r i c t l y limited. N o t f o r h i m the depth
participation that erases the boundaries o f individual awareness
as i n the Indian c u l t o f darshan, the mystic experience o f the
physical presence o f vast numbers o f people.
A game is a machine that can get i n t o action o n l y i f the
players consent t o become puppets f o r a time. F o r individualist
W e s t e r n man, m u c h o f his "adjustment" to society has the character of a personal surrender t o the collective demands. O u r
games help b o t h t o teach us this k i n d o f adjustment and also t o
provide a release f r o m i t . T h e uncertainty o f the outcomes o f
our contests makes a rational excuse f o r the mechanical r i g o r
o f the rules and procedures o f the game.
W h e n the social rules change suddenly, then previously

Games/239
accepted social manners and rituals m a y suddenly assume the
stark outlines and the arbitrary patterns o f a game. T h e Gamesmanship o f Stephen Potter speaks o f a social revolution i n E n g land. T h e English are m o v i n g t o w a r d social equality and the
intense personal c o m p e t i t i o n that goes w i t h equality. T h e older
rituals o f long-accepted class behavior n o w begin t o appear comic
and irrational, gimmicks i n a game. Dale Carnegie's How to Win
Friends and Influence
People first appeared as a solemn manual
o f social wisdom, b u t i t seemed quite ludicrous t o sophisticates.
W h a t Carnegie offered as serious discoveries already seemed like

o f Freudian awareness charged w i t h the psychopathology of
everyday life. A l r e a d y the Freudian patterns o f perception have
become an o u t w o r n code that begins t o provide the cathartic
amusement o f a game, rather than a guide t o l i v i n g .
T h e social practices o f one generation tend t o get codified
i n t o the "game" o f the next. Finally, the game is passed o n as a
joke, like a skeleton stripped o f its flesh. T h i s is especially t r u e
o f periods o f suddenly altered attitudes, resulting f r o m some
radically new technology. I t is the inclusive mesh of the T V
image, i n particular, that spells f o r a w h i l e , at least, the d o o m o f
baseball. F o r baseball is a game o f one-thing-at-a-time, fixed positions and visibly delegated specialist jobs such as belonged t o
the n o w passing mechanical age, w i t h is fragmented tasks and its
staff and line i n management organization. T V , as the v e r y image
o f the n e w corporate and participant ways o f electric l i v i n g ,
fosters habits o f unified awareness and social interdependence
that alienate us f r o m the peculiar style o f baseball, w i t h its specialist and positional stress. W h e n cultures change, so do games.
Baseball, that had become the elegant abstract image of an industrial society l i v i n g b y split-second t i m i n g , has i n the n e w T V
decade lost its psychic and social relevance f o r our n e w w a y o f
life. T h e ball game has been dislodged f r o m the social center and
and been conveyed t o the periphery of A m e r i c a n life.
I n contrast, A m e r i c a n football is nonpositional, and any or
all o f the players can s w i t c h t o any role d u r i n g play. I t is, therefore, a game that at the present is supplanting baseball i n general

acceptance. I t agrees v e r y w e l l w i t h the new needs o f decentralized team play i n the electric age. O f f h a n d , i t m i g h t be supposed
that the t i g h t t r i b a l u n i t y o f football w o u l d make i t a game that
the Russians w o u l d cultivate. T h e i r devotion to ice hockey and
soccer, t w o v e r y individualist forms o f game, w o u l d seem little
suited t o the psychic needs o f a collectivist society. B u t Russia
is still i n the main an oral, t r i b a l w o r l d that is undergoing detribalization and just n o w discovering individualism as a novelty.
Soccer and ice hockey have f o r them, therefore, an exotic and
U t o p i a n quality o f promise that they do n o t convey t o the W e s t .
T h i s is the q u a l i t y that w e tend t o call "snob value," and we
m i g h t derive some similar " v a l u e " f r o m o w n i n g race horses, polo
ponies, or twelve-meter yachts.
Games, therefore, can provide many varieties of satisfaction.
H e r e w e are l o o k i n g at their role as media o f communication i n
society as a w h o l e . Thus, poker is a game that has often been
cited as the expression o f all the complex attitudes and unspoken
values of a competitive society. I t calls f o r shrewdness, aggression,
t r i c k e r y , and unflattering appraisals o f character. I t is said w o m e n
cannot play poker w e l l because i t stimulates their curiosity, and
curiosity is fatal i n poker. Poker is intensely individualist, allowi n g no place f o r kindness or consideration, b u t o n l y f o r the
greatest good of the greatest number—the number one. I t is i n
this perspective that i t is easy t o see w h y w a r has been called the
sport of kings. For kingdoms are t o monarchs w h a t patrimonies
and private income are t o the private citizen. Kings can play
poker w i t h kingdoms, as the generals o f their armies do w i t h
troops. T h e y can b l u f f and deceive the opponent about their
resources and their intentions. W h a t disqualifies w a r f r o m being
a true game is probably w h a t also disqualifies the stock market
and business—the rules are not f u l l y k n o w n nor accepted b y all
the players. Furthermore, the audience is too f u l l y participant
i n w a r and business, just as i n a native society there is no true art
because everybody is engaged i n making art. A r t and games need
rules, conventions, and spectators. T h e y must stand f o r t h f r o m
the over-all situation as models o f i t i n order f o r the quality o f play
to persist. For " p l a y , " whether i n life or i n a wheel, implies

interplay. There must be give and take, or dialogue, as between
t w o o r more persons and groups. T h i s q u a l i t y can, however, be
diminished or lost i n any k i n d o f situation. Great teams often play
practice games w i t h o u t any audience at all. T h i s is not sport i n
our sense, because m u c h o f the quality o f interplay, the v e r y
m e d i u m o f interplay, as i t were, is the feeling of the audience.
Rocket Richard, the Canadian hockey player, used to comment
o n the poor acoustics o f some arenas. H e f e l t that the puck off his
stick rode on the roar o f the c r o w d . Sport, as a popular art f o r m ,
is n o t just self-expression b u t is deeply and necessarily a means
o f interplay w i t h i n an entire culture.
A r t is not just play b u t an extension o f human awareness i n
contrived and conventional patterns. Sport as popular art is a
deep reaction to the t y p i c a l action of the society. B u t high art,
on the other hand, is n o t a reaction b u t a p r o f o u n d reappraisal
o f a complex cultural state. Jean Genet's The Balcony appeals
t o some people as a shatteringly logical appraisal o f mankind's
madness i n its o r g y o f self-destruction. Genet offers a b r o t h e l
enveloped b y the holocaust of w a r and r e v o l u t i o n as an inclusive
image o f human life. I t w o u l d be easy t o argue that Genet is
hysterical, and that f o o t b a l l offers a more serious criticism o f
life than he does. Seen as live models of complex social situations,
games may lack moral earnestness, i t has t o be admitted. Perhaps
there is, just f o r this reason, a desperate need f o r games i n a
h i g h l y specialized industrial culture, since t h e y are the o n l y f o r m
o f art accessible t o m a n y minds. Real interplay is reduced t o
n o t h i n g i n a specialist w o r l d of delegated tasks and fragmented
jobs. Some backward or tribal societies suddenly translated i n t o
industrial and specialist forms o f mechanization cannot easily
devise the antidote o f sports and games t o create countervailing
force. T h e y bog d o w n i n t o g r i m earnest. M e n w i t h o u t art, and
men w i t h o u t the popular arts o f games, tend t o w a r d automatism.

semicircle facing the chair, got instead a m u l t i p l i c i t y of teams
p l a y i n g a great variety o f games. B y t r y i n g f o r u n i t y , the French
g o t anarchy. T h e British, b y setting u p diversity, achieved, i f
anything, too m u c h u n i t y . T h e British representative, b y p l a y i n g
his "side," is n o t tempted i n t o private mental effort, n o r does he
have t o f o l l o w the debates u n t i l the ball is passed t o h i m . As one
c r i t i c said, i f the benches d i d n o t face each other the British
could n o t tell t r u t h f r o m falsehood, nor w i s d o m f r o m f o l l y , unless
t h e y listened t o i t all. A n d since most of the debate must be
nonsense, i t w o u l d be stupid t o listen t o all.
T h e f o r m o f any game is o f first importance. Game theory,
like i n f o r m a t i o n t h e o r y , has ignored this aspect of game and i n f o r m a t i o n movement. B o t h theories have dealt w i t h the i n f o r m a t i o n content o f systems, and have observed the "noise" and
"deception" factors that divert data. T h i s is like approaching a
painting or a musical composition f r o m the p o i n t of v i e w of its
content. I n other w o r d s , i t is guaranteed t o miss the central structural core o f the experience. For as i t is the pdttern o f a game
that gives i t relevance t o our inner lives, and not w h o is p l a y i n g
nor the outcome o f the game, so i t is w i t h i n f o r m a t i o n movement.
T h e selection o f o u r human senses employed makes all the difference say between photo and telegraph. I n the arts the particular
m i x o f our senses i n the m e d i u m employed is all-important. T h e
ostensible p r o g r a m content is a l u l l i n g distraction needed t o
enable the structural f o r m to get t h r o u g h the barriers o f conscious attention.
A n y game, like any m e d i u m o f i n f o r m a t i o n , is an extension
o f the individual or the g r o u p . Its effect o n the group or individual
is a reconfiguring o f the parts o f the g r o u p or individual that are
not so extended. A w o r k o f art has no existence or f u n c t i o n apart
f r o m its effects o n human observers. A n d art, like games o r popular
arts, and like media o f communication, has the power t o impose its
o w n assumptions b y setting the human c o m m u n i t y i n t o n e w
relationships and postures.
A r t , like games, is a translator o f experience. W h a t w e have
already felt or seen i n one situation w e are suddenly given i n a
new k i n d o f material. Games, likewise, shift familiar experience

Games/243
i n t o new forms, g i v i n g the bleak and the blear side o f things
sudden luminosity. T h e telephone companies make tapes of the
blither of boors, w h o inundate defenseless telephone operators
w i t h various kinds o f r e v o l t i n g expressions. W h e n played back
this becomes salutary f u n and play, and helps the operators t o
maintain equilibrium.
T h e w o r l d of science has become quite self-conscious about
the p l a y element i n its endless experiments w i t h models of situations otherwise unobservable. Management training centers have
l o n g used games as a means of developing new business percept i o n . John Kenneth Galbraith argues that business must n o w
study art, f o r the artist makes models o f problems and situations
that have n o t y e t emerged i n the larger m a t r i x of society, g i v i n g
the artistically perceptive businessman a decade o f leeway i n his
planning.
I n the electric age, the closing of the gaps between art and
business, or between campus and c o m m u n i t y , are part of the overall implosion that closes the ranks o f specialists at all levels.
Flaubert, the French novelist of the nineteenth century, felt that
the Franco-Prussian W a r c o u l d have been avoided i f people had
heeded his Sentimental Education.
A similar feeling has since
come t o be w i d e l y held b y artists. T h e y k n o w that they are
engaged i n making live models of situations that have n o t y e t
matured i n the society at large. I n their artistic play, they discovered w h a t is actually happening, and thus t h e y appear t o be
"ahead o f their t i m e . " Non-artists always l o o k at the present
t h r o u g h the spectacles o f the preceding age. General staffs are
always magnificently prepared t o fight the previous w a r .
Games, then, are c o n t r i v e d and controlled situations, extensions o f group awareness that permit a respite f r o m customary
patterns. T h e y are a k i n d o f talking t o itself o n the part o f society
as a w h o l e . A n d t a l k i n g t o oneself is a recognized f o r m o f p l a y
that is indispensable t o any g r o w t h o f self-confidence. T h e
British and Americans have enjoyed d u r i n g recent times an
enormous self-confidence b o r n o f the p l a y f u l spirit of f u n and
games. W h e n they sense the absence o f this spirit i n their rivals,
i t causes embarrassment. T o take mere w o r d l y things i n dead

earnest betokens a defect o f awareness that is pitiable. F r o m the
first days o f Christianity there g r e w a habit, i n some quarters, o f
spiritual c l o w n i n g , o f " p l a y i n g the f o o l i n Christ," as St. Paul p u t
i t . Paul also associated this sense o f spiritual confidence and
Christianity play w i t h the games and sports o f his time. Play goes
w i t h an awareness o f huge disproportion between the ostensible
situation and the real stakes. A similar sense hovers over the game
situation, as such. Since the game, like any art f o r m , is a mere
tangible model o f another situation that is less accessible, there is
always a t i n g l i n g sense of o d d i t y and f u n i n play or games that
renders the v e r y earnest and v e r y serious person or society
laughable. W h e n the V i c t o r i a n Englishman began to lean t o w a r d
the pole o f seriousness, Oscar W i l d e and Bernard Shaw and
G . K . Chesterton moved i n s w i f t l y as countervailing force.
Scholars have o f t e n pointed out that Plato conceived o f play
dedicated to the D e i t y , as the loftiest reach of man's religious
impulse.
Bergson's famous treatise o n laughter sets f o r t h the idea o f
mechanism taking over life-values as the k e y t o the ludicrous.
T o see a man slip o n a banana skin is t o see a rationally structured
system suddenly translated i n t o a w h i r l i n g machine. Since
industrialism had created a similar situation i n the society o f his
time, Bergson's idea was readily accepted. H e seems n o t t o have
noticed that he had mechanically t u r n e d up a mechanical metaphor i n a mechanical age i n order t o explain the v e r y unmechanical t h i n g , laughter, or "the m i n d sneezing," as W y n d h a m Lewis
described i t .
T h e game spirit suffered a defeat a f e w years ago over the
rigged T V quiz shows. F o r one t h i n g , the b i g prize seemed t o make
f u n o f money. M o n e y as store of power and skill, and expediter o f
exchange, still has f o r many people the a b i l i t y t o induce a trance
o f great earnestness. Movies, i n a sense, are also rigged shows. A n y
play or poem or novel is, also, rigged to produce an effect. So was
the T V quiz show. B u t w i t h the T V effect there is deep audience
participation. M o v i e and drama do n o t permit as m u c h participat i o n as that afforded b y the mosaic mesh o f the T V image. So
great was the audience participation i n the quiz shows that the

Games/245
directors of the show were prosecuted as con men. Moreover
press and radio ad interests, bitter about the success o f the n e w
T V medium, were delighted to lacerate the flesh o f their rivals.
O f course, the riggers had been blithely unaware of the nature o f
their medium, and had given i t the movie treatment of intense
realism, instead of the softer m y t h i c focus proper t o T V . Charles
V a n D o r e n merely g o t clobbered as an innocent bystander, and
the w h o l e investigation elicited no insight i n t o the nature or
effects o f the T V medium. Regrettably, i t simply provided a field
day f o r the earnest moralizers. A moral p o i n t of v i e w too often
serves as a substitute f o r understanding i n technological matters.
T h a t games are extensions, not o f our private b u t of our
social selves, and that t h e y are media o f communication, should
n o w be plain. I f , finally, w e ask, " A r e games mass media?" the
answer has t o be "Yes." Games are situations contrived t o p e r m i t
simultaneous participation of many people i n some significant
pattern o f their o w n corporate lives.

T h e wireless telegraph was given spectacular p u b l i c i t y i n 1910 w h e n i t led t o the
arrest at sea o f D r . H a w l e y H . Crippen,
a U.S. physician w h o had been practicing
i n L o n d o n , murdered his w i f e , buried her
i n the cellar o f their home, and fled the
c o u n t r y w i t h his secretary aboard the liner
Montrose. T h e secretary was dressed as a
b o y , and the pair traveled as M r . Robinson
and son. Captain George Kendall o f the
Montrose became suspicious o f the R o b i n sons, having read i n the English papers
about the Crippen case.
T h e Montrose
was one o f the f e w
ships then equipped w i t h Marconi's w i r e less. B i n d i n g his wireless operator t o secrecy, Captain Kendall sent a message t o
Scotland Y a r d , and the Y a r d sent Inspector
Dews o n a faster liner t o race the Montrose across the A t l a n t i c . Inspector Dews,
dressed as a pilot, boarded the
Montrose
before i t reached p o r t , and arrested C r i p pen. Eighteen months after Crippen's ar-

Telegraph/241
rest, an act was passed i n the British Parliament m a k i n g i t c o m pulsory f o r all passenger ships t o c a r r y wireless.
T h e Crippen case illustrates w h a t happens t o the best-laid
plans o f mice and men i n any organization w h e n the instant speed
o f i n f o r m a t i o n movement begins. T h e r e is a collapse o f delegated
a u t h o r i t y and a dissolution o f the p y r a m i d and management
structures made familiar i n the organization chart. T h e separation
o f functions, and the division o f stages, spaces, and tasks are
characteristic o f literate and visual society and o f the W e s t e r n
w o r l d . These divisions tend t o dissolve t h r o u g h the action of the
instant and organic interrelations of electricity.
Former German Armaments minister A l b e r t Speer, i n a
speech at the N u r e m b e r g trials, made some bitter remarks about
the effects o f electric media o n German l i f e : " T h e telephone, the
teleprinter and the wireless made i t possible f o r orders f r o m the
highest levels t o be given direct t o the lowest levels, where, o n
account of the absolute a u t h o r i t y behind them, they were carried
out uncritically . . ."
T h e tendency o f electric media is t o create a k i n d o f organic
interdependence among all the institutions o f society, emphasizing
de Chardin's v i e w that the discovery o f electromagnetism is t o be
regarded as "a prodigious biological event." I f political and c o m mercial institutions take o n a biological character b y means o f
electric communications, i t is also c o m m o n n o w f o r biologists
like Hans Selye t o t h i n k o f the physical organism as a communicat i o n n e t w o r k : " H o r m o n e is a specific chemical messenger-substance, made b y an endocrine gland and secreted i n t o the b l o o d ,
t o regulate and coordinate the functions o f distant organs."
T h i s peculiarity about the electric f o r m , that i t ends the
mechanical age of individual steps and specialist functions, has a
direct explanation. Whereas all previous technology (save speech,
itself) had, i n effect, extended some part o f o u r bodies, electricity
m a y be said to have outered the central nervous system itself,
i n c l u d i n g the brain. O u r central nervous system is a unified field
quite w i t h o u t segments. A s J. Z . Y o u n g writes i n Doubt and Certainty in Science: A Biologist's Reflections on the Brain (Galaxy,
O x f o r d U n i v e r s i t y Press, N e w Y o r k , 1960):

I t may be that a great part of the secret of the brain's
power is the enormous opportunity provided for interaction
between the effects of stimulating each part of the receiving
fields. I t is this provision of interacting-places or mixingplaces that allows us to react to the world as a whole to a
much greater degree than most other animals can do.
Failure t o understand the organic character o f electric techn o l o g y is evident i n our continuing concern w i t h the dangers o f
mechanizing the w o r l d . Rather, w e are i n great danger o f w i p i n g
out our entire investment i n the preelectric technology o f the
literate and mechanical k i n d b y means of an indiscriminate use o f
electrical energy. W h a t makes a mechanism is the separation and
extension o f separate parts o f our b o d y as hand, arm, feet, i n pen,
hammer, wheel. A n d the mechanization of a task is done b y
segmentation o f each part of an action i n a series o f u n i f o r m ,
repeatable, and movable parts. T h e exact opposite characterizes
cybernation ( o r automation), w h i c h has been described as a w a y
o f t h i n k i n g , as m u c h as a w a y o f doing. Instead of being concerned
w i t h separate machines, cybernation looks at the p r o d u c t i o n
problem as an integrated system o f i n f o r m a t i o n handling.
I t is this same provision o f interacting places i n the electric
media that n o w compels us t o react t o the w o r l d as a whole.
A b o v e all, however, i t is the speed o f electric involvement that
creates the integral w h o l e of b o t h private and public awareness.
W e live today i n the A g e of I n f o r m a t i o n and of Communication
because electric media instantly and constantly create a total
field o f interacting events i n w h i c h all men participate. N o w , the
w o r l d of public interaction has the same inclusive scope o f integral
interplay that has hitherto characterized o n l y our private nervous
systems. T h a t is because electricity is organic i n character and
confirms the organic social b o n d b y its technological use i n telegraph and telephone, radio, and other forms. T h e simultaneity o f
electric communication, also characteristic of our nervous system, makes each o f us present and accessible t o every other person i n the w o r l d . T o a large degree our co-presence everywhere
at once i n the electric age is a fact o f passive, rather than active,

Telegraph/249
experience. A c t i v e l y , we,are more l i k e l y t o have this awareness
w h e n reading the newspaper or w a t c h i n g a T V show.
One w a y t o grasp the change f r o m the mechanical to the
electric age is b y n o t i c i n g the difference between the l a y o u t o f a
l i t e r a r y and a telegraph press, say between the L o n d o n Times
and the Daily Express, or between The New York Times and the
N e w Y o r k Daily News. I t is the difference between columns representing points o f v i e w , and a mosaic o f unrelated scraps i n a
field unified b y a dateline. Whatever else there is, there can be no
p o i n t o f v i e w i n a mosaic o f simultaneous items. T h e w o r l d o f
impressionism, associated w i t h painting i n the late nineteenth cent u r y , f o u n d its more extreme f o r m i n the pointillisme o f Seurat
and the refractions o f l i g h t i n the w o r l d of M o n e t and Renoir.
T h e stipple of points o f Seurat is close t o the present technique of
sending pictures b y telegraph, and close t o the f o r m of the T V
image or mosaic made b y the scanning finger. A l l o f these anticipate later electric forms because, like the digital computer w i t h
its multiple yes-no dots and dashes, t h e y caress the contours o f
every k i n d of being b y the multiple touches of these points.
E l e c t r i c i t y offers a means of getting i n t o u c h w i t h every facet of
being at once, like the b r a i n itself. E l e c t r i c i t y is o n l y incidentally
visual and a u d i t o r y ; i t is p r i m a r i l y tactile.
A s the age o f electricity began t o establish itself i n the later
nineteenth century, the entire w o r l d o f the arts began t o reach
again f o r the iconic qualities o f t o u c h and sense interplay ( s y n esthesia, as i t was called) i n p o e t r y , as i n painting. T h e German
sculptor A d o l f v o n H i l d e b r a n d inspired Berenson's remark that
"the painter can accomplish his task o n l y b y g i v i n g tactile values
t o retinal impressions." Such a program involves the e n d o w i n g o f
each plastic f o r m w i t h a k i n d o f nervous system o f its o w n .
T h e electric f o r m o f pervasive impression is p r o f o u n d l y
tactile and organic, e n d o w i n g each object w i t h a k i n d o f unified
sensibility, as the cave painting had done. T h e unconscious task
o f the painter i n the n e w electric age was t o raise this fact t o the
level o f conscious awareness. F r o m this time o n , the mere specialist i n any field was doomed t o the sterility and i n a n i t y that echoed

250/Understanding

an archaic f o r m o f the departing mechanical age. Contemporaryawareness had t o become integral and inclusive again, after centuries o f dissociated sensibilities. T h e Bauhaus school became one
o f the great centers o f e f f o r t tending t o w a r d an inclusive human
awareness; b u t the same task was accepted b y a race o f giants that
sprang u p i n music and poetry, architecture, and painting. T h e y
gave the arts o f this c e n t u r y an ascendancy over those o f other
ages comparable t o that w h i c h w e have l o n g recognized as true
o f m o d e r n science.
D u r i n g its early g r o w t h , the telegraph was subordinate t o
r a i l w a y and newspaper, those immediate extensions o f industrial
p r o d u c t i o n and marketing. I n fact, once the railways began t o
stretch across the continent, t h e y relied v e r y m u c h o n the telegraph
f o r their coordination, so that the image o f the stationmaster and
the telegraph operator were easily superimposed i n the A m e r i c a n
mind.
I t was i n 1844 that Samuel Morse opened a telegraph line
f r o m W a s h i n g t o n t o Baltimore w i t h $30,000 obtained f r o m C o n gress. Private enterprise, as usual, w a i t e d f o r bureaucracy t o clari f y the image and goals o f the n e w operation. Once i t proved
profitable, the f u r y o f private p r o m o t i o n and initiative became
impressive, leading t o some savage episodes. N o n e w technology,
n o t even the railroad, manifested a more rapid g r o w t h than the
telegraph. B y 1858 the first cable had been laid across the A t l a n t i c ,
and b y 1861 telegraph wires had reached across America. T h a t each
new method o f transporting c o m m o d i t y or i n f o r m a t i o n should have
t o come i n t o existence i n a bitter competitive battle against p r e v i ously existing devices is n o t surprising. Each innovation is n o t o n l y
commercially disrupting, b u t socially and psychologically c o r r o d i n g , as w e l l .
I t is instructive t o f o l l o w the embryonic stages o f any new
g r o w t h , f o r d u r i n g this period o f development i t is m u c h misunderstood, whether i t be p r i n t i n g or the motorcar o r T V . Just
because people are at first oblivious o f its nature, the n e w f o r m

Telstar, as you know, is that complicated ball that whirls
through space, transmitting television broadcasts, telephone
messages, and everything except common sense. W h e n i t was
first cast aloft, trumpets sounded. Continents would share
each other's intellectual pleasures. Americans would enjoy
Brigitte Bardot. Europeans would partake of the heady i n tellectual stimulation of "Ben Casey.". . . The fundamental
flaw i n this communications miracle is the same one that has
bugged every communications miracle since they started carving hieroglyphics on stone tablets. W h a t do you say on it?
Telstar went into operation in August when almost nothing
of importance was happening anywhere i n Europe. A l l the
networks were ordered to say something, anything, on this
miracle instrument. " I t was a new toy and they just had to
use i t , " the men here say. CBS combed Europe for hot news
and came up w i t h a sausage-eating contest, which was duly
sent back via the miracle ball, although that particular news
event could have gone by camelback without losing any of
its essence.
A n y innovation threatens the equilibrium o f existing organization. I n b i g i n d u s t r y n e w ideas are invited t o rear their heads so
that they can be clobbered at once. T h e idea department o f a b i g

I n the same year, 1844, then, that men were p l a y i n g chess and
lotteries o n the first American telegraph, Soren Kierkegaard
published The Concept of Dread. T h e A g e o f A n x i e t y had begun.
F o r w i t h the telegraph, man had initiated that outering or extension of his central nervous system that is n o w approaching an
extension o f consciousness w i t h satellite broadcasting. T o p u t
one's nerves outside, and one's physical organs inside the nervous
system, or the brain, is t o initiate a situation—if n o t a concept—of
dread.
H a v i n g glanced at the major trauma o f the telegraph o n conscious life, n o t i n g that i t ushers i n the A g e o f A n x i e t y and o f Pervasive Dread, w e can t u r n to some specific instances o f this uneasiness
and g r o w i n g jitters. Whenever any n e w medium or human extension occurs, i t creates a new m y t h f o r itself, usually associated
w i t h a major figure: A r e t i n o , the Scourge of Princes and the
Puppet of P r i n t i n g ; Napoleon and the trauma o f industrial change;
Chaplin, the public conscience o f the movie; H i t l e r , the t r i b a l
totem of radio; and Florence Nightingale, the first singer of
human woe b y telegraph w i r e .
Florence Nightingale (1820-1910), w e a l t h y and refined m e m ber o f the p o w e r f u l new English g r o u p engendered b y industrial
power, began t o p i c k u p human-distress signals, as a y o u n g lady.
T h e y were quite undecipherable at first. T h e y upset her entire
w a y o f life, and couldn't be adjusted t o her image o f parents or
friends or suitors. I t was sheer genius that enabled her t o translate
the new diffused anxiety and dread o f life i n t o the idea o f deep
human involvement and hospital r e f o r m . She began t o t h i n k , as
w e l l as to live, her time, and she discovered the new f o r m u l a f o r

Telegraph/253
the electronic age: Medicare. Care of the b o d y became balm f o r
the nerves i n the age that had extended its nervous system outside
itself f o r the first time i n human history.
T o p u t the Florence Nightingale story i n new media terms
is quite simple. She arrived on a distant scene where controls
f r o m the L o n d o n center were o f the c o m m o n pre-electric
hierarchical pattern. M i n u t e division and delegation of functions
and separation o f powers, normal i n m i l i t a r y and industrial o r ganization then and l o n g afterward, created an imbecile system
o f waste and inefficiency Which f o r the first time got reported
daily b y telegraph. T h e legacy of literacy and visual fragmentat i o n came home t o roost every day o n the telegraph w i r e :
I n England f u r y succeeded fury. A great storm of rage,
humiliation, and despair had been gathering through the terrible winter of 1854-1855. For the first time i n history, through
reading the dispatches of Russell, the public had realized
" w i t h what majesty the British soldier fights." A n d these
heroes were dead. The men who had stormed the heights of
Alma, charged w i t h the Light Brigade at Balaclava . . . had
perished of hunger and neglect. Even horses which had taken
part i n the Charge of the Light Brigade had starved to death.
(Lonely Crusader, Cecil Woodham-Smith, M c G r a w - H i l l )
T h e horrors that W i l l i a m H o w a r d Russell relayed b y w i r e t o
The Times were n o r m a l i n British m i l i t a r y life. H e was the first
w a r correspondent, because the telegraph gave that immediate and
inclusive dimension o f " h u m a n interest" t o news that does n o t
belong t o a " p o i n t o f v i e w . " I t is merely a comment o n our absentmindedness and general indifference that after more than a c e n t u r y
o f telegraph news r e p o r t i n g , n o b o d y has seen that " h u m a n i n terest" is the electronic or depth dimension of immediate i n v o l v e ment i n news. W i t h telegraph, there ended that separation of
interests and division o f faculties that are certainly n o t w i t h o u t
their magnificent monuments of t o i l and ingenuity. B u t w i t h telegraph, came the integral insistence and wholeness o f Dickens, and o f
Florence Nightingale, and o f H a r r i e t Beecher Stowe. T h e electric
gives p o w e r f u l voices t o the weak and suffering, and sweeps aside
the bureaucratic specialisms and job descriptions of the m i n d tied

t o a manual of instructions. T h e " h u m a n interest" dimension is
simply that of immediacy o f participation i n the experience o f
others that occurs w i t h instant i n f o r m a t i o n . People become instant,
too, i n their response o f p i t y or o f f u r y w h e n they must share the
c o m m o n extension o f the central nervous system w i t h the w h o l e o f
mankind. U n d e r these conditions, "conspicuous waste" o r " c o n spicuous consumption" become lost causes, and even the hardiest
o f the r i c h d w i n d l e i n t o modest ways o f t i m i d service t o m a n k i n d .
A t this p o i n t , some m a y still inquire w h y the telegraph should
create " h u m a n interest," and w h y the earlier press d i d not. T h e
section o n T h e Press m a y help these readers. B u t there m a y also
be a l u r k i n g obstacle t o perception. T h e instant all-at-onceness
and total involvement o f the telegraphic f o r m still repels some
literary sophisticates. F o r them, visual c o n t i n u i t y and fixed " p o i n t
o f v i e w " render the immediate participation o f the instant media
as distasteful and unwelcome as popular sports. These people are
as m u c h media victims, u n w i t t i n g l y mutilated b y their studies and
t o i l , as children i n a V i c t o r i a n blacking f a c t o r y . F o r m a n y people,
then, w h o have had their sensibilities irremediably skewed and
locked i n t o the fixed postures o f mechanical w r i t i n g and p r i n t i n g ,
the iconic forms o f the electric age are as opaque, or even as i n visible, as hormones t o the unaided eye. I t is the artist's job t o
t r y t o dislocate older media i n t o postures that p e r m i t attention
t o the new. T o this end, the artist must ever play and experiment
w i t h new means o f arranging experience, even t h o u g h the majori t y o f his audience may prefer t o remain fixed i n their o l d
perceptual attitudes. T h e most that can be done b y the prose c o m mentator is t o capture the media i n as m a n y characteristic and
revealing postures as he can manage t o discover. L e t us examine
a series of these postures o f the telegraph, as this n e w m e d i u m
encounters other media like the b o o k and the newspaper.
B y 1848 the telegraph, then o n l y f o u r years o l d , compelled
several major A m e r i c a n newspapers t o f o r m a collective organizat i o n f o r newsgathering. T h i s e f f o r t became the basis o f the A s sociated Press, w h i c h , i n t u r n , sold news service t o subscribers. I n
one sense, the real meaning of this f o r m o f the electric, instant
coverage was concealed b y the mechanical overlay o f the visual

Telegraph/255
and industrial patterns o f p r i n t and p r i n t i n g . T h e specificallyelectric effect may seem t o appear i n this instance as a centralizing
and compressional force. B y many analysts, the electric r e v o l u t i o n has been regarded as a continuation o f the process o f the
mechanization o f m a n k i n d . Closer inspection reveals quite a d i f ferent character. F o r example, the regional press, that had had t o
r e l y o n postal service and political c o n t r o l t h r o u g h the post office,
q u i c k l y escaped f r o m this center-margin t y p e of m o n o p o l y b y
means o f the new telegraph services. Even i n England, where short
distances and concentrated population made the r a i l w a y a p o w e r f u l agent o f centralism, the m o n o p o l y o f L o n d o n was dissolved
b y the invention o f the telegraph, w h i c h n o w encouraged p r o v i n cial competition. T h e telegraph freed the marginal provincial
press f r o m dependence o n the b i g metropolitan press. I n the w h o l e
field o f the electric r e v o l u t i o n , this pattern o f decentralization
appears i n multiple guises. I t is Sir L e w i s Namier's v i e w that
telephone and airplane are the biggest single cause o f trouble i n
the w o r l d today. Professional diplomats w i t h delegated powers
have been supplanted b y prime ministers, presidents, and f o r e i g n
secretaries, w h o t h i n k t h e y c o u l d conduct all important negotiations personally. T h i s is also the problem encountered i n b i g
business, where i t has been f o u n d impossible t o exercise delegated
a u t h o r i t y w h e n using the telephone. T h e v e r y nature of the telephone, as all electric media, is t o compress and u n i f y that w h i c h
had previously been divided and specialized. O n l y the " a u t h o r i t y o f
k n o w l e d g e " w o r k s b y telephone because of the speed that creates
a total and inclusive field of relations. Speed requires that the
decisions made be inclusive, n o t fragmentary or partial, so that
literate people t y p i c a l l y resist the telephone. B u t radio and T V , w e
shall see, have the same p o w e r o f imposing an inclusive order, as
o f an oral organization. Q u i t e i n contrast is the center-margin
f o r m o f visual and w r i t t e n structures o f a u t h o r i t y .
M a n y analysts have been misled b y electric media because o f
the seeming ability o f these media t o extend man's spatial powers
o f organization. Electric media, however, abolish the spatial dimension, rather than enlarge i t . B y electricity, w e everywhere resume
person-to-person relations as i f on the smallest village scale. I t is a

256/Understanding

Media

relation i n depth, and w i t h o u t delegation o f functions o r powers.
T h e organic everywhere supplants the mechanical. Dialogue
supersedes the lecture. T h e greatest dignitaries hobnob w i t h y o u t h .
W h e n a group o f O x f o r d undergraduates heard that R u d y a r d
K i p l i n g received ten shillings f o r every w o r d he w r o t e , t h e y sent
h i m ten shillings b y telegram d u r i n g their meeting: "Please send
us one o f y o u r v e r y best w o r d s . " Back came the w o r d a f e w
minutes later: " T h a n k s . "
T h e hybrids o f electricity and the older mechanics have been
numerous. Some o f them, such as the phonograph and the movie,
are discussed elsewhere i n this volume. T o d a y the w e d d i n g o f
mechanical and electric technology draws t o a close, w i t h T V
replacing the movie and Telstar threatening the wheel. A c e n t u r y
ago the effect o f the telegraph was t o send the presses racing faster,
just as the application of the electric spark was t o make possible
the internal-combustion engine w i t h its instant precision. Pushed
further, however, the electric principle everywhere dissolves the
mechanical technique o f visual separation and analysis o f f u n c tions. Electronic tapes w i t h exactly synchronized i n f o r m a t i o n
replace the o l d lineal sequence o f the assembly line.
Acceleration is a f o r m u l a f o r dissolution and b r e a k d o w n i n
any organization. Since the entire mechanical technology o f the
W e s t e r n w o r l d has been wedded t o electricity, i t has pushed
t o w a r d higher speeds. A l l the mechanical aspects of our w o r l d
seem to probe t o w a r d self-liquidation. T h e U n i t e d States had b u i l t
up a large degree o f central political controls t h r o u g h the interplay
o f the railway, the post office, and the newspaper. I n 1848 the Postmaster General w r o t e , i n his report, that newspapers have "always
been esteemed o f so m u c h importance t o the public, as the best
means o f disseminating intelligence among the people, that the
lowest rate has always been afforded f o r the purpose o f encouraging their c i r c u l a t i o n . " T h e telegraph q u i c k l y weakened this
center-margin pattern and, more i m p o r t a n t , b y intensifying the
volume o f news, i t greatly weakened the role o f editorial opinions.
N e w s has steadily overtaken views as a shaper of public attitudes,
t h o u g h f e w examples of this change are quite so striking as the
sudden g r o w t h of the Florence N i g h t i n g a l e image i n the British

Telegraph/251
w o r l d . A n d yet n o t h i n g has been more misunderstood than the
p o w e r of the telegraph i n this matter. Perhaps the most decisive
feature is this. T h e natural dynamic of the book and, also, newspaper is to create a unified national o u t l o o k on a centralized
pattern. A l l literate people, therefore, experience a desire f o r an
extension of the most enlightened opinions i n a u n i f o r m horizontal
and homogeneous pattern t o the "most b a c k w a r d areas," and to
the least literate minds. T h e telegraph ended that hope. I t decentralized the newspaper w o r l d so t h o r o u g h l y that u n i f o r m
national views were quite impossible, even before the C i v i l W a r .
Perhaps an even more i m p o r t a n t consequence of the telegraph
was that i n America the l i t e r a r y talent was d r a w n into journalism,
rather than into the b o o k medium. Poe and T w a i n and H e m i n g w a y are examples of w r i t e r s w h o c o u l d find neither training nor
outlet save t h r o u g h the newspaper. I n Europe, on the other hand,
the numerous small national groups presented a discontinuous
mosaic that the telegraph merely intensified. T h e result was that
the telegraph i n Europe strengthened the position of the book, and
f o r c e d even the press t o assume a l i t e r a r y character.
N o t least o f the developments since the telegraph has been the
weather forecast, perhaps the most p o p u l a r l y participative of all
the human interest items i n the daily press. I n the early days of
telegraph, rain created problems i n the g r o u n d i n g o f wires. These
problems d r e w attention t o weather dynamics. One report i n
Canada i n 1883 stated: " I t was early discovered that w h e n the
w i n d at M o n t r e a l was f r o m the East or N o r t h - E a s t , rain storms
traveled f r o m the W e s t , and the stronger the land current, the
faster came the rain f r o m the opposite d i r e c t i o n . " I t is clear that
telegraph, b y p r o v i d i n g a w i d e sweep of instant information, c o u l d
reveal meteorological patterns of force quite beyond observation b y
pre-electric man.

T h e comments o f Robert L i n c o l n O'Brien,
w r i t i n g i n the Atlantic Monthly i n 1904,
indicate a r i c h field o f social material that
still remains unexplored. For example:
The invention of the typewriter has
given a tremendous impetus to the
dictating habit. . . . This means not
only greater diffuseness . . . but i t also
brings forward the point of view of the
one who speaks. There is the disposition on the part of the talker to explain,
as if watching the facial expression of
his hearers to see how far they are
following. This attitude is not lost
when his audience is following. I t is
no uncommon thing i n the typewriting
booths at the Capitol i n Washington to
see Congressmen in dictating letters
use the most vigorous gestures as i f the
oratorical methods of persuasion could
be transmitted to the printed page.
I n 1882, ads proclaimed that the t y p e w r i t e r
could be used as an aid i n learning t o read,
w r i t e , spell, and punctuate. N o w , eighty

The

Typewriter/259

years later, the t y p e w r i t e r is used o n l y i n experimental classrooms.
T h e ordinary classroom still holds the t y p e w r i t e r at bay as a
merely attractive and distractive t o y . B u t poets like Charles Olson
are eloquent i n proclaiming the power o f the t y p e w r i t e r to help
the poet t o indicate exactly the breath, the pauses, the suspension,
even, o f syllables, the juxtaposition, even, o f parts of phrases w h i c h
he intends, observing that, f o r the first time, the poet has the stave
and the bar that the musician has had.
T h e same k i n d o f autonomy and independence w h i c h Charles
Olson claims that the t y p e w r i t e r confers o n the voice o f the poet
was claimed f o r the t y p e w r i t e r b y the career w o m a n of fifty years
ago. British w o m e n were reputed t o have developed a " t w e l v e p o u n d l o o k " w h e n t y p e w r i t e r s became available f o r sixty dollars
or so. T h i s look was i n some w a y related t o the V i k i n g gesture
o f Ibsen's N o r a Helmer, w h o slammed the door of her doll's house
and set off on a quest o f vocation and soul-testing. T h e age of the
i r o n w h i m had begun.
T h e reader w i l l recall earlier mention that w h e n the first wave
o f female typists h i t the business office i n the 1890s, the cusp i d o r manufacturers read the sign o f doom. T h e y were r i g h t .
M o r e important, the u n i f o r m ranks o f fashionable lady typists
made possible a r e v o l u t i o n i n the garment industry. W h a t she
w o r e , every farmer's daughter wanted t o wear, f o r the t y p i s t was
a popular figure o f enterprise and skill. She was a style-maker
w h o was also eager t o f o l l o w styles. A s m u c h as the t y p e w r i t e r ,
the t y p i s t brought i n t o business a new dimension o f the u n i f o r m ,
the homogeneous, and the continuous that has made the t y p e w r i t e r indispensable t o every aspect o f mechanical industry. A
modern battleship needs dozens o f t y p e w r i t e r s f o r ordinary operations. A n army needs more typewriters than medium and l i g h t
a r t i l l e r y pieces, even i n the field, suggesting that the t y p e w r i t e r
n o w fuses the functions o f the pen and s w o r d .
B u t the effect o f the t y p e w r i t e r is n o t all o f this k i n d . I f the
t y p e w r i t e r has contributed greatly to the familiar forms o f the
homogenized specialism and fragmentation that is p r i n t culture,
i t has also caused an integration of functions and the creation o f
m u c h private independence. G . K . Chesterton demurred about

260/Understanding

this new independence as a delusion, remarking that " w o m e n
refused to be dictated t o and w e n t out and became stenographers."
T h e poet or novelist n o w composes o n the t y p e w r i t e r . T h e t y p e w r i t e r fuses composition and publication, causing an entirely new
attitude to the w r i t t e n and printed w o r d . Composing o n the
t y p e w r i t e r has altered the forms of the language and o f literature
i n ways best seen i n the later novels o f H e n r y James that were
dictated to Miss Theodora Bosanquet, w h o t o o k them d o w n , n o t
b y shorthand, b u t o n a t y p e w r i t e r . H e r memoir, Henry James at
Work, should have been f o l l o w e d b y other studies o f h o w the
t y p e w r i t e r has altered English verse and prose, and, indeed, the
v e r y mental habits, themselves, of w r i t e r s .
W i t h H e n r y James, the t y p e w r i t e r had become a confirmed
habit b y 1907, and his new style developed a sort o f free, i n cantatory quality. H i s secretary tells o f h o w he f o u n d dictating
n o t o n l y easier b u t more inspiring than composing b y hand: " I t
all seems to be so m u c h more effectively and unceasingly pirfled
out of me i n speech than i n w r i t i n g , " he t o l d her. Indeed, he became so attached t o the sound of his t y p e w r i t e r that, o n his deathbed, H e n r y James called f o r his R e m i n g t o n t o be w o r k e d near his
bedside.
Just h o w m u c h the t y p e w r i t e r has contributed b y its u n justified right-hand margin to the development of vers libre w o u l d
be hard to discover, b u t free verse was really a recovery o f spoken,
dramatic stress i n poetry, and the t y p e w r i t e r encouraged exactly
this quality. Seated at the t y p e w r i t e r , the poet, m u c h i n the manner o f the jazz musician, has the experience of performance as
composition. I n the nonliterate w o r l d , this had been the situation
o f the bard or minstrel. H e had themes, b u t no text. A t the t y p e w r i t e r , the poet commands the resources o f the p r i n t i n g press.
T h e machine is like a public-address system immediately at hand.
H e can shout or whisper or whistle, and make f u n n y typographic
faces at the audience, as does E. E. Cummings i n this sort o f verse:

E. E. Cummings is here using the t y p e w r i t e r t o provide a
poem w i t h a musical score f o r choral speech. T h e older poet,
separated f r o m the p r i n t f o r m b y various technical stages, c o u l d
enjoy none of the freedom o f oral stress provided b y the t y p e w r i t e r . T h e poet at the t y p e w r i t e r can do N j i n s k y leaps or
Chaplin-like shuffles and wiggles. Because he is an audience f o r his
o w n mechanical audacities, he never ceases t o react t o his o w n performance. Composing o n the t y p e w r i t e r is like f l y i n g a kite.

E l i o t and Pound used the t y p e w r i t e r f o r a great variety o f
central effects i n their poems. A n d w i t h them, too, the t y p e w r i t e r
was an oral and mimetic instrument that gave them the colloquial
freedom of the w o r l d of jazz and ragtime. Most colloquial and
jazzy of all Eliot's poems, Sweeney Agonistes, i n its first appearance
i n p r i n t , carried the note: " F r o m W a n n a G o H o m e Baby?"
T h a t the t y p e w r i t e r , w h i c h carried the Gutenberg technolo g y into every n o o k and cranny o f our culture and economy
should, also, have given o u t w i t h these opposite oral effects is a
characteristic reversal. Such a reversal o f f o r m happens i n all
extremes o f advanced technology, as w i t h the wheel today.
As expediter, the t y p e w r i t e r b r o u g h t w r i t i n g and speech and
publication into close association. A l t h o u g h a merely mechanical
f o r m , i t acted i n some respects as an implosion, rather than an
explosion.
I n its explosive character, c o n f i r m i n g the existing procedures
of moveable types, the t y p e w r i t e r had an immediate effect i n regulating spelling and grammar. T h e pressure of Gutenberg techn o l o g y t o w a r d " c o r r e c t " or u n i f o r m spelling and grammar was
felt at once. T y p e w r i t e r s caused an enormous expansion i n the sale
o f dictionaries. T h e y also created the innumerable overstuffed files
that led t o the rise of the file-cleaning companies i n our time.
A t first, however, the t y p e w r i t e r was n o t seen as indispensable t o
business. T h e personal t o u c h of the hand-penned letter was c o n sidered so i m p o r t a n t that the t y p e w r i t e r was ruled o u t o f c o m mercial use b y the pundits. T h e y thought, however, that i t m i g h t
be of use t o authors, clergymen, and telegraph operators. Even
newspapers were l u k e w a r m about this machine f o r some time.
Once any part of the economy feels a step-up i n pace, the
rest of the economy has to f o l l o w suit. Soon, no business could be
indifferent t o the greatly increased pace set b y the t y p e w r i t e r .
I t was the telephone, paradoxically, that sped the commercial
adoption o f the t y p e w r i t e r . T h e phrase "Send me a memo o n that,"
repeated into millions of phones daily, helped t o create the huge
expansion of the t y p i s t f u n c t i o n . N o r t h c o t e Parkinson's l a w that
" w o r k expands so as t o fill the time available f o r its c o m p l e t i o n "
is precisely the zany dynamic p r o v i d e d b y the telephone. I n no

The

Typewriter/263

time at all, the telephone expanded the w o r k t o be done on the
t y p e w r i t e r to huge dimensions. Pyramids o f paperwork rise on
the basis o f a small telephone n e t w o r k inside a single business.
L i k e the t y p e w r i t e r , the telephone fuses functions, enabling the
call-girl, f o r example, t o be her o w n procurer and madam.
N o r t h c o t e Parkinson had discovered that any business or
bureaucratic structure functions b y itself, independently of "the
w o r k t o be done." T h e number o f personnel and "the q u a l i t y
o f the w o r k are not related t o each other at a l l . " I n any given
structure, the rate o f staff accumulation is n o t related t o the w o r k
done b u t to the intercommunication among the staff, itself. ( I n
other words, the medium is the message.) Mathematically stated,
Parkinson's L a w says that the rate of accumulation of office staff
per annum w i l l be between 5.17 per cent and 6.56 per cent,
"irrespective of any variation i n the amount o f w o r k ( i f a n y )
to be done."
" W o r k to be done," o f course, means the transformation o f
one k i n d o f material energy i n t o some new f o r m , as trees i n t o
lumber or paper, or clay i n t o bricks or plates, or metal i n t o pipe.
I n terms o f this k i n d o f w o r k , the accumulation of office personnel
in a navy, f o r example, goes up as the number o f ships goes d o w n .
W h a t Parkinson carefully hides f r o m himself and his readers is
simply the fact that i n the area o f i n f o r m a t i o n movement, the
main " w o r k to be done" is actually the movement of i n f o r m a t i o n .
T h e mere interrelating o f people b y selected i n f o r m a t i o n is n o w
the principal source o f w e a l t h i n the electric age. I n the preceding
mechanical age, w o r k had n o t been like that at all. W o r k had
meant the processing of various materials b y assembly-line f r a g mentation of operations and hierarchically delegated a u t h o r i t y .
Electric power circuits, i n relation t o the same processing, eliminate b o t h the assembly line and the delegated a u t h o r i t y . Especially
w i t h the computer, the w o r k effort is applied at the " p r o g r a m m i n g " level, and such e f f o r t is one of i n f o r m a t i o n and knowledge.
I n the decision-making and "make happen" aspect of the w o r k
operation, the telephone and other such speed-ups of i n f o r m a t i o n
have ended the divisions o f delegated a u t h o r i t y i n favor of the

end at once all the delegation and specialism of the symphony

industrial age. T h e t y p e w r i t e r , w i t h regard t o the poet or novelist,
comes v e r y close t o the promise o f electronic music, insofar as i t
compresses or unifies the various jobs o f poetic composition and
publication.
T h e historian Daniel Boorstin was scandalized b y the fact
that celebrity i n our i n f o r m a t i o n age was n o t due t o a person's
having done a n y t h i n g b u t simply t o his being k n o w n f o r being

o f human w o r k n o w seems to be quite independent of any job t o

reason is simple. Positional warfare is finished, b o t h i n private and
corporate action. I n business, as i n society, " g e t t i n g o n " m a y mean
getting out. T h e r e is no "ahead" i n a w o r l d that is an echo chamber

o f t o u c h or of sense interplay that even more intimately involves
the entire sensorium.
T h e child and the teenager understand the telephone, embraci n g the c o r d and the ear-mike as i f they were beloved pets. W h a t
w e call "the French phone," the u n i o n of mouthpiece and earphone
i n a single instrument, is a significant indication of the French
liaison of the senses that English-speaking people keep f i r m l y
separate. French is "the language o f l o v e " just because i t unites
voice and ear i n an especially close w a y , as does the telephone. So
i t is quite natural t o kiss via phone, b u t n o t easy to visualize while
phoning.
N o more unexpected social result o f the telephone has been
observed than its elimination o f the r e d - l i g h t district and its creat i o n of the call-girl. T o the b l i n d , all things are unexpected. T h e
f o r m and character o f the telephone, as o f all electric technology,
appear f u l l y i n this spectacular development. T h e prostitute was a
specialist, and the call-girl is not. A "house" was n o t a home; b u t
the call-girl n o t o n l y lives at home, she may be a m a t r o n . T h e
p o w e r of the telephone t o decentralize every operation and t o
end positional warfare, as w e l l as localized prostitution, has been
f e l t b u t not understood b y every business i n the land.
T h e telephone, i n the case o f the call-girl, is like the t y p e w r i t e r that fuses the functions o f composition and publication.
T h e call-girl dispenses w i t h the procurer and the madam. She
has t o be an articulate person o f varied conversation and social
accomplishments since she is expected t o be able t o j o i n any
company on a basis o f social equality. I f the t y p e w r i t e r has
splintered w o m a n f r o m the home and t u r n e d her into a specialist
i n the office, the telephone gave her back t o the executive w o r l d
as a general means o f harmony, an invitation t o happiness, and a
sort o f combined confessional-and-wailing w a l l f o r the immature
A m e r i c a n executive.
T h e t y p e w r i t e r and the telephone are most unidentical twins
that have taken over the revamping o f the A m e r i c a n g i r l w i t h
technological ruthlessness and thoroughness.
Since all media are fragments o f ourselves extended i n t o

to b r i n g the other senses into play i n a n e w relation. As w e read,
w e provide a sound t r a c k f o r the printed w o r d ; as w e listen t o the
radio, w e provide a visual accompaniment. W h y can w e n o t
visualize w h i l e telephoning? A t once the reader w i l l protest, " B u t
I do visualize on the telephone!" W h e n he has a chance t o t r y the
experiment deliberately, he w i l l find that he simply can't visualize
w h i l e phoning, t h o u g h all literate people t r y t o do so and, therefore, believe they are succeeding. B u t that is n o t w h a t most irritates
the literate and visualizing Westerner about the telephone. Some
people can scarcely talk t o their best friends o n the phone w i t h o u t
becoming angry. T h e telephone demands complete participation,
unlike the w r i t t e n and printed page. A n y literate man resents
such a heavy demand f o r his total attention, because he has l o n g
been accustomed t o fragmentary attention. Similarly, literate man
can learn t o speak other languages o n l y w i t h great difficulty, f o r
learning a language calls f o r participation o f all the senses at once.
O n the other hand, our habit o f visualizing renders the literate
Westerner helpless i n the nonvisual w o r l d o f advanced physics.
O n l y the visceral and audile-tactile T e u t o n and Slav have the
needed i m m u n i t y t o visualization f o r w o r k i n the non-Euclidean
m a t h and quantum physics. W e r e w e t o teach our m a t h and
physics b y telephone, even a h i g h l y literate and abstract Westerner
c o u l d eventually compete w i t h the European physicists. T h i s fact
does n o t interest the Bell Telephone research department, f o r l i k e
any other book-oriented g r o u p t h e y are oblivious t o the telephone
as a form, and study o n l y the content aspect o f w i r e service. A s
already mentioned, the Shanner and W e a v e r hypothesis about
I n f o r m a t i o n T h e o r y , like the Morgenstern Game T h e o r y , tends
to ignore the f u n c t i o n of the f o r m as f o r m . T h u s b o t h I n f o r m a t i o n T h e o r y and Game T h e o r y have bogged d o w n i n t o sterile
banalities, b u t the psychic and social changes resulting f r o m these
forms have altered the w h o l e o f our lives.
M a n y people feel a strong urge t o " d o o d l e " w h i l e telephoning.
T h i s fact is v e r y m u c h related t o the characteristic o f this m e d i u m ,
namely that i t demands participation o f o u r senses and faculties.
U n l i k e radio, i t cannot be used as background. Since the telephone
offers a v e r y poor a u d i t o r y image, w e strengthen and complete

i t b y the use o f all the other senses. W h e n the a u d i t o r y image
is o f high definition, as w i t h radio, w e visualize the experience
o r complete i t w i t h the sense of sight. W h e n the visual image is
o f high definition or intensity, w e complete i t b y p r o v i d i n g sound.
T h a t is w h y , w h e n the movies added sound track, there was such
deep artistic upset. I n fact the disturbance was almost equal t o that
caused b y the movie itself. For the movie is a rival o f the book,
tending t o provide a visual track o f narrative description and statement that is m u c h fuller than the w r i t t e n w o r d .
I n the 1920s a popular song was " A H A l o n e b y the Telephone,
A l l A l o n e Feeling Blue." W h y should the phone create an intense
feeling o f loneliness? W h y should w e feel compelled t o answer a
r i n g i n g public phone w h e n w e k n o w the call cannot concern us?
W h y does a phone r i n g i n g on the stage create instant tension?
W h y is that tension so v e r y m u c h less f o r an unanswered phone
i n a movie scene? T h e answer t o all o f these questions is simply
that the phone is a participant f o r m that demands a partner, w i t h
all the intensity o f electric polarity. I t simply w i l l n o t act as a
background instrument like radio.
A standard practical joke o f the small t o w n i n the early days
o f the telephone draws attention t o the phone as a f o r m of
communal participation. N o back fence could begin t o rival the
degree o f heated participation made possible b y the partyline.
T h e joke i n question t o o k the f o r m o f calling several people, and,
i n an assumed voice, saying that the engineering department was
going t o clean o u t the telephone lines: " W e recommend that y o u
cover y o u r telephone w i t h a sheet o r p i l l o w case t o prevent y o u r
r o o m f r o m being filled w i t h d i r t and grease." T h e jokester w o u l d
then make the rounds o f his friends i n question t o enjoy their
preparations and their momentary expectation o f a hiss and roar
that was sure t o come w h e n the lines were b l o w n out. T h e joke
n o w serves t o recall that n o t l o n g ago the phone was a new
contraption, used more f o r entertainment than f o r business.
T h e i n v e n t i o n of the telephone was an incident i n the larger
effort o f the past century to render speech visible. Melville Bell,
the father o f Alexander Graham Bell, spent his life devising a
universal alphabet that he published i n 1867 under the title Visible

The

Telephone/769

Speech. Besides the aim t o make all the languages of the w o r l d
immediately present t o each other i n a simple visual f o r m , the
Bells, father and son, w e r e m u c h concerned t o improve the state
o f the deaf. Visible speech seemed t o promise immediate means
o f release f o r the deaf f r o m their prison. T h i r struggle t o perfect
visible speech f o r the deaf led the Bells t o a study of the new
electrical devices that yielded the telephone. I n m u c h the same
w a y , the Braille system o f dots-for-letters had begun as a means
o f reading m i l i t a r y messages i n darkness, then was transferred t o
music, and finally t o reading f o r the b l i n d . Letters had been
codified as dots f o r the fingers l o n g before the Morse Code was
developed f o r telegraph use. A n d i t is relevant t o note h o w
electric technology, i n like manner, had converged o n the w o r l d
o f speech and language, f r o m the beginning o f electricity. T h a t
w h i c h had been the first great extension of our central nervous
system—the mass media o f the spoken word—was soon wedded t o
the second great extension o f the central nervous system—electric
technology.
T h e N e w Y o r k Daily Graphic f o r M a r c h 15, 1877, p o r t r a y e d
o n its f r o n t page " T h e T e r r o r s of the Telephone—The O r a t o r
o f the F u t u r e . " A disheveled Svengali stands before a m i c r o phone haranguing i n a studio. T h e same m i k e is shown i n L o n d o n ,
San Francisco, on the Prairies, and i n D u b l i n . Curiously, the
newspaper of that time saw the telephone as a rival t o the press as
P. A . system, such as radio was i n fact to be fifty years later. B u t
the telephone, intimate and personal, is the most removed of any
m e d i u m f r o m the P. A . f o r m . T h u s w i r e - t a p p i n g seems even more
odious than the reading of other people's letters.
T h e w o r d "telephone" came into existence i n 1840, before
Alexander Graham Bell was b o r n . I t was used t o describe a
device made t o convey musical notes t h r o u g h w o o d e n rods. B y
the 1870s, inventors i n many places were t r y i n g t o achieve the
electrical transmission o f speech, and the A m e r i c a n Patent Office
received Elisha Gray's design f o r a telephone o n the same day as
Bell's, b u t an hour or t w o later. T h e legal profession benefited
enormously f r o m this coincidence. B u t Bell g o t the fame, and his
rivals became footnotes. T h e telephone presumed t o offer service

t o the public i n 1877, paralleling w i r e telegraphy. T h e n e w telephone group was p u n y beside the vast telegraph interests, and
W e s t e r n U n i o n moved at once t o establish c o n t r o l over the telephone service.
I t is one of the ironies o f W e s t e r n man that he has never felt
any concern about invention as a threat t o his w a y o f life. T h e
fact is that, f r o m the alphabet t o the motorcar, W e s t e r n man has
been steadily refashioned i n a slow technological explosion that
has extended over 2,500 years. F r o m the time o f the telegraph
o n w a r d , however, W e s t e r n man began t o live an implosion. H e
began suddenly w i t h Nietzschean insouciance to play the movie of
his 2,500-year explosion backward. B u t he still enjoys the results
o f the extreme fragmentation o f the original components of his
tribal life. I t is this fragmentation that enables h i m t o ignore causeand-effect i n all interplay o f technology and culture. I t is quite
different i n B i g Business. There, tribal man is o n the alert f o r stray
seeds o f change. T h a t was w h y W i l l i a m H . W h y t e c o u l d w r i t e

Even g r a f t i n g people i n t o the ulcer o f a b i g corporation seems
w r o n g t o a n y b o d y b r o u g h t up i n literate visual fragmented freedom. " I call them u p at n i g h t w h e n their guard's d o w n , " said one
senior executive.
I n the 1920s, the telephone spawned a good deal o f dialogue
humor that sold as gramophone records. B u t radio and the talking
pictures were n o t k i n d t o the monologue, even w h e n i t was made
b y W . C. Fields or W i l l Rogers. These h o t media pushed aside the
cooler forms that T V has n o w b r o u g h t back on a large scale. T h e
n e w race o f n i g h t - c l u b entertainers ( N e w h a r t , N i c h o l s and M a y )
have a curious early-telephone flavor that is v e r y welcome, indeed.
W e can thank T V , w i t h its call f o r such high participation, that
mime and dialogue are back. O u r M o r t Sahls and Shelley Bermans
and Jack Paars are almost a variety o f " l i v i n g newspaper," such as
was provided f o r the Chinese revolutionary masses b y dramatic
teams i n the 1930s and 1940s. Brecht's plays have the same participational q u a l i t y o f the w o r l d of the comic strip and the newspaper mosaic that T V has made acceptable, as p o p art.
T h e mouthpiece o f the telephone was a direct o u t g r o w t h

o f a prolonged attempt beginning i n the seventeenth century t o
m i m i c human physiology b y mechanical means. I t is v e r y m u c h
i n the nature o f the electric telephone, therefore, that i t has such
natural c o n g r u i t y w i t h the organic. O n the advice of a Boston
surgeon, D r . C. J. Blake, the receiver of the phone was d i r e c t l y
modeled on the bone and diaphragm structure o f the human ear.
Bell paid m u c h attention t o the w o r k of the great H e l m h o l t z ,
whose w o r k covered m a n y fields. Indeed, i t was because of his
c o n v i c t i o n that H e l m h o l t z had sent vowels b y telegraph that Bell
was encouraged t o persevere i n his efforts. I t t u r n e d out that i t
was his inadequate German that had fostered this optimistic i m pression. H e l m h o l t z had failed t o achieve any speech effects b y
wire. B u t Bell argued, i f vowels could be sent, w h y n o t c o n sonants? " I thought that H e l m h o l t z , himself, had done i t , and that
m y failure was due o n l y t o m y ignorance of electricity. I t was a
v e r y valuable blunder. I t gave me confidence. I f I had been able t o
read German i n those days I m i g h t never have commenced m y
experiments!"
One o f the most startling consequences o f the telephone was
its i n t r o d u c t i o n of a "seamless w e b " o f interlaced patterns i n management and decision-making. I t is n o t feasible t o exercise delegated a u t h o r i t y b y telephone. T h e pyramidal structure o f j o b division and description and delegated powers cannot withstand
the speed o f the phone t o by-pass all hierarchical arrangements,
and t o involve people i n depth. I n the same w a y , mobile panzer
divisions equipped w i t h radio telephones upset the traditional a r m y
structure. A n d w e have seen h o w the news reporter l i n k i n g the
printed page to the telephone and the telegraph created a unified
corporate image o u t of the fragmented government departments.
T o d a y the j u n i o r executive can get o n a first-name basis w i t h
seniors i n different parts of the c o u n t r y . " Y o u just start telephoning. A n y b o d y can w a l k i n t o any manager's office b y telephone.
B y ten o'clock of the day I h i t the N e w Y o r k office I was calling
everybody b y their first names."
T h e telephone is an irresistible i n t r u d e r i n time or place, so
that high executives attain i m m u n i t y t o its call o n l y w h e n d i n i n g
at head tables. I n its nature the telephone is an intensely personal

27'2/Understanding

f o r m that ignores all the claims o f visual p r i v a c y prized b y literate
man. One firm o f stockbrokers recently abolished all private
offices f o r its executives, and settled them around a k i n d of seminar
table. I t was f e l t that the instant decisions that had to be made
based on the continuous f l o w o f teletype and other electric media
could o n l y receive group approval fast enough i f private space
were abolished. W h e n on the alert, even the grounded crews o f
m i l i t a r y aircraft cannot be o u t o f sight o f one another at any time.
This is merely a time factor. M o r e relevant is the need f o r total
involvement i n role that goes w i t h this instant structure. T h e t w o
pilots of one Canadian jet fighter are matched w i t h all the care
used i n a marriage bureau. A f t e r m a n y tests and l o n g experience
together they are officially married b y their commanding officer
" t i l l death do y o u p a r t . " T h e r e is no tongue-in-cheek about this.
I t is this same k i n d o f total integration into a role that raises the
hackles o f any literate man faced b y the implosive demands of the
seamless w e b of electric decision-making. Freedom i n the W e s t e r n
w o r l d has always taken the f o r m o f the explosive, the divisive,
advancing the separation o f the individual f r o m the state. T h e
reversal o f that one-way movement o u t w a r d f r o m center-to-marg i n is as clearly o w i n g to electricity as the great W e s t e r n explosion
had, i n the first place, been due t o phonetic literacy.
I f delegated chain-of-command a u t h o r i t y w o n ' t w o r k b y telephone b u t o n l y b y w r i t t e n instruction, w h a t sort o f a u t h o r i t y
does come into play? T h e answer is simple, b u t n o t easy t o convey.
O n the telephone o n l y the a u t h o r i t y o f knowledge w i l l w o r k .
Delegated a u t h o r i t y is lineal, visual, hierarchical. T h e a u t h o r i t y
o f knowledge is nonlineal, nonvisual, and inclusive. T o act, the
delegated person must always get clearance f r o m the chain-ofcommand. T h e electric situation eliminates such patterns; such
"checks and balances" are alien t o the inclusive a u t h o r i t y of
knowledge. Consequently, restraints on electric absolutist power
can be achieved, n o t b y the separation o f powers, b u t b y a p l u ralism o f centers. T h i s problem has arisen apropos o f the direct
private line f r o m the K r e m l i n t o the W h i t e House. President
Kennedy stated his preference f o r teletype over telephone, w i t h
a natural W e s t e r n bias.

The

T h e separation o f powers had been a technique f o r restraini n g action i n a centralist structure radiating out t o remote margins. I n an electric structure there are, so far as the time and
space of this planet are concerned, no margins. There can, therefore, be dialogue o n l y among centers and among equals. T h e chainof-command pyramids cannot obtain support f r o m electric techn o l o g y . B u t i n place o f delegated power, there tends t o appear
again w i t h electric media, the role. A person can n o w be reinvested w i t h all kinds o f nonvisual character. K i n g and emperor
were legally endowed t o act as the collective ego o f all the private
egos o f their subjects. So far, Western man has encountered the
restoration of the role o n l y tentatively. H e still manages t o keep
individuals i n delegated jobs. I n the cult o f the movie star, w e have
allowed ourselves somnambulistically t o abandon our W e s t e r n
traditions, conferring o n these jobless images a mystic role. T h e y
are collective embodiments of the multitudinous private lives of
their subjects.
A n extraordinary instance of the p o w e r of the telephone t o
involve the whole person is recorded b y psychiatrists, w h o r e p o r t
that neurotic children lose all neurotic symptoms w h e n telephoni n g . The New York Times of September 7, 1949 printed an i t e m
that provides bizarre testimony t o the cooling participational
character o f the telephone:
O n September 6, 1949, a psychotic veteran, H o w a r d B.
Unrah, i n a mad rampage on the streets of Camden, N e w
Jersey, killed thirteen people, and then returned home. Emergency crews, bringing up machine guns, shotguns, and tear
gas bombs, opened fire. A t this point an editor on the Camden
Evening Courier looked up Unruh's name i n the telephone
directory and called him. U n r u h stopped firing and answered,
"Hello."
"This Howard?"
"Yes
"
" W h y are you killing people?"
" I don't know. I can't answer that yet. I ' l l have to talk to
you later. I ' m too busy n o w . "

ished individual vocal a c t i v i t y , m u c h as the car had reduced
pedestrian a c t i v i t y .
L i k e the radio that i t still provides w i t h p r o g r a m content,
the phonograph is a hot medium. W i t h o u t i t , the t w e n t i e t h cent u r y as the era o f tango, ragtime, and jazz w o u l d have had a different r h y t h m . But the phonograph was involved i n many misconceptions, as one o f its early names—gramophone—implies. I t was
conceived as a f o r m o f a u d i t o r y w r i t i n g (gramma-lctters).
I t was
also called "graphophone," w i t h the needle i n the role of pen.
T h e idea o f i t as a " t a l k i n g machine" was especially popular.
Edison was delayed i n his approach t o the solution o f its problems
b y considering i t at first as a "telephone repeater"; that is, a storehouse of data f r o m the telephone, enabling the telephone t o " p r o vide invaluable records, instead o f being the recipient of moment a r y and fleeting communication." These words of Edison,
published i n the North American Review of June, 1878, illustrate
h o w the then recent telephone invention already had the power
t o color t h i n k i n g i n other fields. So, the record player had to be
seen as a k i n d o f phonetic r e c o r d o f telephone conversation.
Hence, the names " p h o n o g r a p h " and "gramophone."
Behind the immediate p o p u l a r i t y o f the phonograph was the
entire electric implosion that gave such new stress and importance
to actual speech r h y t h m s i n music, p o e t r y , and dance alike. Y e t
the phonograph was a machine merely. I t d i d n o t at first use an
electric m o t o r or circuit. B u t i n p r o v i d i n g a mechanical extension
o f the human voice and the new ragtime melodies, the phonograph was propelled into a central place b y some o f the major
currents o f the age. T h e fact o f acceptance of a n e w phrase, or
a speech f o r m , or a dance r h y t h m is already direct evidence of
some actual development to w h i c h i t is significantly related. Take,
f o r example, the shift o f English i n t o an interrogative m o o d , since
the arrival o f " H o w about that?" N o t h i n g could induce people
to begin suddenly to use such a phrase over and over, unless there
were some new stress, r h y t h m , or nuance i n interpersonal relations that gave i t relevance.
I t was w h i l e handling paper tape, impressed b y Morse Code
dots and dashes, that Edison noticed the sound given off w h e n

The

Phonograph/111

the tape moved at high speed resembled " h u m a n talk heard indist i n c t l y . " I t then occurred t o h i m that indented tape could record
a telephone message. Edison became aware of the limits of lineality
and the sterility o f specialism as soon as he entered the electric
field. " L o o k , " he said, "it's like this. I start here w i t h the intention
o f reaching here i n an experiment, say, t o increase the speed of
the A t l a n t i c cable; b u t w h e n I've arrived part w a y i n m y straight
line, I meet w i t h a phenomenon, and i t leads me off i n another
^direction and develops i n t o a phonograph." N o t h i n g could more
dramatically express the t u r n i n g p o i n t f r o m mechanical explosion
t o electrical implosion. Edison's o w n career embodied that v e r y
change i n our w o r l d , and he himself was often caught i n the
confusion between the t w o forms of procedure.
I t was just at the end o f the nineteenth century that the
psychologist Lipps revealed b y a k i n d o f electric audiograph that
the single clang o f a bell was an intensive m a n i f o l d containing all
possible symphonies. I t was somewhat o n the same lines that E d i son approached his problems. Practical experience had taught
h i m that embryonically all problems contained all answers w h e n
one c o u l d discover a means of rendering them explicit. I n his o w n
case, his determination t o give the phonograph, like the telephone,
a direct practical use i n business procedures led t o his neglect o f
the instrument as a means o f entertainment. Failure t o foresee the
phonograph as a means o f entertainment was really a failure t o
grasp the meaning of the electric r e v o l u t i o n i n general. I n o u r
time w e are reconciled t o the phonograph as a t o y and a solace;
b u t press, radio, and T V have also acquired the same dimension
o f entertainment. Meantime, entertainment pushed t o an extreme
becomes the main f o r m o f business and politics. Electric media,
because o f their total " f i e l d " character, tend t o eliminate the
fragmented specialties o f f o r m and f u n c t i o n that w e have l o n g
accepted as the heritage of alphabet, p r i n t i n g , and mechanization.
T h e brief and compressed history o f the phonograph includes all
phases o f the w r i t t e n , the printed, and the mechanized w o r d . I t
was the advent of the electric tape recorder that o n l y a f e w years
ago released the phonograph f r o m its temporary involvement i n
mechanical culture. T a p e and the l . p . record suddenly made the

27'8/Understanding

Media

phonograph a means of access t o all the music and speech of the
world.
Before t u r n i n g t o the l.p. and tape-recording revolution, w e
should note that the earlier period o f mechanical recording and
sound reproduction had one large factor i n c o m m o n w i t h the
silent picture. T h e early phonograph produced a brisk and raucous
experience n o t unlike that of a M a c k Sennett movie. B u t the
undercurrent o f mechanical music is strangely sad. I t was the
genius o f Charles Chaplin t o have captured f o r film this sagging
quality of a deep blues, and to have overlaid i t w i t h jaunty jive
and bounce. T h e poets and painters and musicians o f the later
nineteenth century all insist on a sort o f metaphysical melancholy
as latent i n the great industrial w o r l d of the metropolis. T h e
Pierrot figure is as crucial i n the p o e t r y o f L a f orgue as i t is i n the art
o f Picasso or the music of Satie. Is n o t the mechanical at its best
a remarkable approximation t o the organic? A n d is n o t a great
industrial civilization able t o produce a n y t h i n g i n abundance f o r
everybody? T h e answer is "Yes." B u t Chaplin and the Pierrot
poets and painters and musicians pushed this logic all the w a y t o
reach the image o f Cyrano de Bergerac, w h o was the greatest
lover o f all, b u t w h o was never permitted the r e t u r n o f his love.
T h i s w e i r d image o f Cyrano, the unloved and unlovable lover,
was caught up i n the phonograph c u l t o f the blues. Perhaps i t is
misleading t o t r y to derive the o r i g i n o f the blues f r o m N e g r o
f o l k music; however, Constant Lambert, English c o n d u c t o r - c o m poser, i n his Music Ho!, provides an account o f the blues that
preceded the jazz o f the p o s t - W o r l d W a r I . H e concludes that
the great flowering of jazz i n the twenties was a popular response
to the h i g h b r o w richness and orchestral subtlety o f the DebussyDelius period. Jazz w o u l d seem t o be an effective bridge between
h i g h b r o w and l o w b r o w music, m u c h as Chaplin made a similar
bridge f o r pictorial art. L i t e r a r y people eagerly accepted these
bridges, and Joyce g o t Chaplin i n t o Ulysses as B l o o m , just as
E l i o t got jazz i n t o the r h y t h m s o f his early poems.
Chaplin's c l o w n - C y r a n o is as m u c h a part of a deep melanc h o l y as Laforgue's or Satie's Pierrot art. Is i t n o t inherent i n the
v e r y t r i u m p h of the mechanical and its omission o f the human?

The

Phonograph/279

C o u l d the mechanical reach a higher level than the talking machine w i t h its mime of voice and dance? D o n o t T . S. Eliot's
famous lines about the t y p i s t of the jazz age capture the entire
pathos o f the age o f Chaplin and the ragtime blues?
W h e n lovely woman stoops to folly and
Paces about her room again, alone,
She smoothes her hair w i t h automatic hand,
A n d puts a record on the gramophone.
Read as a Chaplin-like comedy, Eliot's P r u f r o c k makes ready
sense. P r u f r o c k is the complete Pierrot, the little puppet o f the
mechanical civilization that was about t o do a flip i n t o its electric
phase.
I t w o u l d be difficult t o exaggerate the importance of complex
mechanical forms such as f i l m and phonograph as the prelude t o
the automation o f human song and dance. As this automation o f
human voice and gesture had approached perfection, so the human
w o r k force approached automation. N o w i n the electric age the
assembly line w i t h its human hands disappears, and electric automation brings about a w i t h d r a w a l o f the w o r k force f r o m industry.
Instead of being automated themselves—fragmented i n task and
function—as had been the tendency under mechanization, men i n
the electric age move increasingly t o involvement i n diverse jobs
simultaneously, and t o the w o r k o f learning, and t o the p r o g r a m m i n g of computers.
T h i s revolutionary logic inherent i n the electric age was made
f a i r l y clear i n the early electric forms o f telegraph and telephone
that inspired the " t a l k i n g machine." These n e w forms that d i d so
m u c h t o recover the vocal, a u d i t o r y , and mimetic w o r l d that had
been repressed b y the p r i n t e d w o r d , also inspired the strange n e w
r h y t h m s o f "the jazz age," the various forms o f syncopation and
symbolist discontinuity that, like r e l a t i v i t y and quantum physics,
heralded the end o f the Gutenberg era w i t h its smooth, u n i f o r m
lines o f t y p e and organization.
T h e w o r d "jazz" comes f r o m the French jaser, t o chatter.
Jazz is, indeed, a f o r m o f dialogue among instrumentalists and dancers alike. T h u s i t seemed t o make an abrupt break w i t h the h o m o -

geneous and repetitive r h y t h m s o f the smooth waltz. I n the age
o f Napoleon and L o r d B y r o n , w h e n the w a l t z was a n e w f o r m ,
i t was greeted as a barbaric f u l f i l l m e n t o f the Rousseauistic dream
o f the noble savage. Grotesque as this idea n o w appears, i t is really
a most valuable clue t o the d a w n i n g mechanical age. T h e i m personal choral-dancing o f the older, c o u r t l y pattern was abandoned w h e n the waltzers held each other i n a personal embrace.
T h e w a l t z is precise, mechanical, and m i l i t a r y , as its history manifests. F o r a w a l t z t o y i e l d its f u l l meaning, there must be m i l i t a r y
dress. " T h e r e was a sound of r e v e l r y b y n i g h t " was h o w L o r d
B y r o n referred t o the w a l t z i n g before W a l t e r l o o . T o the eighteenth century and t o the age o f Napoleon, the citizen armies
seemed t o be an individualistic release f r o m the feudal f r a m e w o r k
o f c o u r t l y hierarchies. Hence the association of w a l t z w i t h noble
savage, meaning no more than freedom f r o m status and hierarchic
deference. T h e waltzers were all u n i f o r m and equal, having free
movement i n any part of the hall. T h a t this was the Romantic idea
o f the life o f the noble savage n o w seems o d d , b u t the Romantics
k n e w as little about real savages as t h e y d i d about assembly lines.
I n our o w n c e n t u r y the arrival o f jazz and ragtime was also
heralded as the invasion o f the b o t t o m - w a g g i n g native. T h e
indignant tended t o appeal f r o m jazz t o the beauty o f the mechanical and repetitive w a l t z that had once been greeted as pure
native dancing. I f jazz is considered as a break w i t h mechanism
i n the direction o f the discontinuous, the participant, the spontaneous and improvisational, i t can also be seen as a r e t u r n t o a sort
o f oral poetry i n w h i c h performance is b o t h creation and composit i o n . I t is a t r u i s m among jazz performers that recorded jazz is
"as stale as yesterday's newspaper." Jazz is alive, like conversation;
and like conversation i t depends u p o n a repertory o f available
themes. B u t performance is composition. Such performance i n sures maximal participation among players and dancers alike.
Put i n this w a y , i t becomes obvious at once that jazz belongs
i n that f a m i l y of mosaic structures that reappeared i n the W e s t e r n
w o r l d w i t h the w i r e services. I t belongs w i t h symbolism i n poetry,
and w i t h the m a n y allied forms i n painting and i n music.
T h e b o n d between the phonograph and song and dance is no

The

Phonograph/2%\

less deep than its earlier relation to telegraph and telephone.
W i t h the first p r i n t i n g o f musical scores i n the sixteenth century,
words and music d r i f t e d apart. T h e separate virtuosity of voice
and instruments became the basis o f the great musical developments o f the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. T h e same k i n d
o f fragmentation and specialism i n the arts and sciences made
possible m a m m o t h results i n industry and i n m i l i t a r y enterprise,
and i n massive cooperative enterprises such as the newspaper and
the s y m p h o n y orchestra.
Certainly the phonograph as a p r o d u c t o f industrial, assemblyline organization and distribution showed little o f the electric
qualities that had inspired its g r o w t h i n the m i n d o f Edison.
T h e r e were prophets w h o could foresee the great day w h e n the
phonograph w o u l d aid medicine b y p r o v i d i n g a medical means
o f discrimination between "the sob of hysteria and the sigh o f
melancholia . . . the r i n g o f w h o o p i n g cough and the hack of
the consumptive. I t w i l l be an expert i n insanity, distinguishing
between the laugh o f the maniac and drivel o f the idiot. . . . I t
w i l l accomplish this feat i n the anteroom, w h i l e the physician is
busying himself w i t h his last patient." I n practice, however, the
phonograph stayed w i t h the voices o f the Signor Foghornis, the
basso-tenores, robusto-profundos.
Recording facilities d i d n o t presume t o t o u c h a n y t h i n g so
subtle as an orchestra u n t i l after the First W a r . L o n g before this,
one enthusiast looked t o the record t o r i v a l the photograph album
and t o hasten the happy day w h e n " f u t u r e generations w i l l be able
t o condense w i t h i n the space o f t w e n t y minutes a tone-picture of
a single lifetime: five minutes o f a child's prattle, five o f the boy's
exultations, five o f the man's reflections, and five f r o m the feeble
utterances of the deathbed." James Joyce, somewhat later, d i d
better. H e made Finnegans Wake a tone poem that condensed i n
a single sentence all the prattlings, exultations, observations, and
remorse o f the entire human race. H e c o u l d n o t have conceived
this w o r k i n any other age than the one that produced the phonograph and the radio.
I t was radio that finally injected a f u l l electric charge i n t o
the w o r l d o f the phonograph. T h e radio receiver o f 1924 was

282/'Understanding

Media

already superior i n sound quality, and soon began t o depress the
phonograph and record business. Eventually, radio restored the
record business b y extending popular taste i n the direction of the
classics.
T h e real break came after the Second W a r w i t h the availability of the tape recorder. T h i s meant the end o f the incision
recording and its attendant surface noise. I n 1949 the era o f
electric h i - f i was another rescuer o f the phonograph business.
T h e h i - f i quest f o r "realistic sound" soon merged w i t h the T V
image as part of the recovery of tactile experience. F o r the sensat i o n o f having the p e r f o r m i n g instruments " r i g h t i n the r o o m
w i t h y o u " is a striving t o w a r d the u n i o n o f the audile and tactile
i n a finesse of fiddles that is i n large degree the sculptural experience. T o be i n the presence o f p e r f o r m i n g musicians is t o experience their t o u c h and handling o f instruments as tactile and kinetic,
n o t just as resonant. So i t can be said that h i - f i is n o t any quest
f o r abstract effects of sound i n separation f r o m the other senses.
W i t h h i - f i , the phonograph meets the T V tactile challenge.
Stereo sound, a f u r t h e r development, is " a l l - a r o u n d " or "wrap>
a r o u n d " sound. Previously sound had emanated f r o m a single
point i n accordance w i t h the bias o f visual culture w i t h its fixed
p o i n t of v i e w . T h e h i - f i changeover was really f o r music w h a t
cubism had been f o r painting, and w h a t symbolism had been f o r
literature; namely, the acceptance o f m u l t i p l e facets and planes i n
a single experience. A n o t h e r w a y t o p u t i t is t o say that stereo is
sound i n depth, as T V is the visual i n depth.
Perhaps i t is n o t v e r y c o n t r a d i c t o r y that w h e n a medium
becomes a means o f depth experience the o l d categories o f
"classical" and " p o p u l a r " or o f " h i g h b r o w " and " l o w b r o w " no
longer obtain. W a t c h i n g a blue-baby heart operation o n T V is an
experience that w i l l fit none of the categories. W h e n I.p. and h i - f i
and stereo arrived, a depth approach t o musical experience also
came i n . E v e r y b o d y lost his inhibitions about " h i g h b r o w , " and
the serious people lost their qualms about popular music and
culture. A n y t h i n g that is approached i n depth acquires as m u c h
interest as the greatest matters. Because " d e p t h " means " i n interrelation," n o t i n isolation. D e p t h means insight, n o t p o i n t o f v i e w ;

The

and insight is a k i n d o f mental involvement i n process that makes
the content of the i t e m seen quite secondary. Consciousness itself
is an inclusive process n o t at all dependent o n content. Consciousness does not postulate consciousness o f a n y t h i n g i n particular.
W i t h regard t o jazz, l . p . b r o u g h t m a n y changes, such as the
c u l t o f "real cool d r o o l , " because the greatly increased length o f a
single side o f a disk meant that the jazz band could really have a
l o n g and casual chat among its instruments. T h e repertory of the
1920s was revived and given n e w depth and complexity b y this
n e w means. But the tape recorder i n combination w i t h l . p . revolutionized the r e p e r t o r y o f classical music. Just as tape meant the
new study o f spoken rather than w r i t t e n languages, so i t b r o u g h t
i n the entire musical culture o f many centuries and countries.
W h e r e before there had been a n a r r o w selection f r o m periods
and composers, the tape recorder, combined w i t h l . p . , gave a f u l l
musical spectrum that made the sixteenth century as available as
the nineteenth, and Chinese f o l k song as accessible as the H u n garian.
A brief summary o f technological events relating t o the
phonograph m i g h t go this w a y :
T h e telegraph translated w r i t i n g i n t o sound, a fact d i r e c t l y
related to the o r i g i n o f b o t h the telephone and phonograph. W i t h
the telegraph, the o n l y walls l e f t are the vernacular walls that the
photograph and movie and w i r e p h o t o overleap so easily. T h e
electrification o f w r i t i n g was almost as b i g a step i n t o the n o n visual and auditory space as the later steps soon taken b y telephone,

I n England the movie theater was o r i g i nally called " T h e Bioscope," because of its

idea of change i n organic beings was that
o f the substitution o f one static f o r m f o r
another, i n sequence. T h e y imagined the
life of a f l o w e r as a k i n d of cinematic strip
of phases or essences. T h e movie is the
total realization o f the medieval idea of

Movies/'285
change, i n the f o r m o f an entertaining illusion. Physiologists had
v e r y m u c h to do w i t h the development o f film, as they d i d w i t h
the telephone. O n film the mechanical appears as organic, and the
g r o w t h o f a flower can be portrayed as easily and as freely as the
movement o f a horse.
I f the movie merges the mechanical and organic i n a w o r l d of
undulating forms, i t also links w i t h the technology o f p r i n t . T h e
reader i n projecting w o r d s , as i t were, has t o f o l l o w the black and
w h i t e sequences o f stills that is t y p o g r a p h y , p r o v i d i n g his o w n
sound track. H e tries t o f o l l o w the contours of the author's m i n d ,
at v a r y i n g speeds and w i t h various illusions o f understanding.
I t w o u l d be difficult t o exaggerate the b o n d between p r i n t and
movie i n terms o f their p o w e r to generate fantasy i n the viewer
or reader. Cervantes devoted his Don Quixote entirely t o this
aspect o f the p r i n t e d w o r d and its p o w e r t o create w h a t James
Joyce t h r o u g h o u t Finnegans Wake designates as "the A B C E D m i n d e d , " w h i c h can be taken as "ab-said" or "ab-sent," or just
alphabetically controlled.
T h e business of the w r i t e r or the film-maker is t o transfer
the reader or viewer f r o m one w o r l d , his own, t o another, the
w o r l d created b y t y p o g r a p h y and film. T h a t is so obvious, and
happens so completely, that those undergoing the experience
accept i t subliminally and w i t h o u t critical awareness. Cervantes
lived i n a w o r l d i n w h i c h p r i n t was as n e w as movies are i n the
West, and i t seemed obvious t o h i m that p r i n t , like the images
n o w o n the screen, had usurped the real w o r l d . T h e reader or
spectator had become a dreamer under their spell, as René Clair
said o f film i n 1926.
Movies as a nonverbal f o r m of experience are like photograp h y , a f o r m of statement w i t h o u t syntax. I n fact, however, like
the p r i n t and the photo, movies assume a h i g h level of literacy i n
their users and prove baffling t o the nonliterate. O u r literate
acceptance o f the mere movement of the camera eye as i t f o l l o w s
or drops a figure f r o m v i e w is n o t acceptable to an A f r i c a n film
audience. I f somebody disappears off the side o f the film, the

w i t h o u t questioning the logic of lineality, w i l l accept film sequence
w i t h o u t protest.
I t was René Clair w h o pointed o u t that i f t w o or three people
were together on a stage, the dramatist must ceaselessly motivate
or explain their being there at all. B u t the film audience, like the
book reader, accepts mere sequence as rational. W h a t e v e r the
camera turns t o , the audience accepts. W e are transported t o another w o r l d . A s René Clair observed, the screen opens its w h i t e
door into a harem of beautiful visions and adolescent dreams,
compared to w h i c h the loveliest real b o d y seems defective. Yeats
saw the movie as a w o r l d of Platonic ideals w i t h the film projector
playing "a spume u p o n a ghostly paradigm o f things." T h i s was
the w o r l d that haunted D o n Quixote, w h o f o u n d i t t h r o u g h the
folio door of the n e w l y p r i n t e d romances.
T h e close relation, then, between the reel w o r l d o f film and
the private fantasy experience of the p r i n t e d w o r d is indispensable
t o our Western acceptance o f the film f o r m . Even the film indust r y regards all of its greatest achievements as derived f r o m novels,
nor is this unreasonable. F i l m , b o t h i n its reel f o r m and i n its
scenario or script f o r m , is completely involved w i t h b o o k culture.
A l l one need do is t o imagine f o r a moment a film based o n newspaper f o r m i n order t o see h o w close film is t o book. Theoretically,
there is no reason w h y the camera should n o t be used t o p h o t o graph complex groups o f items and events i n dateline configurations, just as they are presented o n the page of a newspaper.
A c t u a l l y , p o e t r y tends t o do this c o n f i g u r i n g or " b u n c h i n g " more
than prose. Symbolist p o e t r y has m u c h i n c o m m o n w i t h the

they move their eyes over photo or screen as t h e y m i g h t their
hands. I t is this same habit of using the eyes as hands that makes
European men so "sexy" t o A m e r i c a n w o m e n . O n l y an extremely

288/'Understanding

Media

literate and abstract society learns t o fix the eyes, as w e must
learn t o do i n reading the p r i n t e d page. F o r those w h o thus fix
their eyes, perspective results. T h e r e is great subtlety and synesthesia i n native art, b u t no perspective. T h e o l d belief that everyb o d y really saw i n perspective, b u t o n l y that Renaissance painters
had learned h o w t o paint i t , is erroneous. O u r o w n first T V
generation is r a p i d l y losing this habit o f visual perspective as a
sensory modality, and along w i t h this change comes an interest
i n w o r d s , n o t as visually u n i f o r m and continuous, b u t as unique
w o r l d s i n depth. Hence the craze f o r puns and w o r d - p l a y , even
i n sedate ads.
I n terms o f other media such as the printed page, film has
the power to store and to convey a great deal o f i n f o r m a t i o n .
I n an instant i t presents a scene of landscape w i t h figures that
w o u l d require several pages o f prose t o describe. I n the next
instant i t repeats, and can go o n repeating, this detailed i n f o r m a t i o n . T h e w r i t e r , o n the other hand, has no means o f holding
a mass o f detail before his reader i n a large bloc or gestalt. A s
the photograph urged the painter i n the direction o f abstract,
sculptural art, so the film has confirmed the w r i t e r i n verbal
economy and depth symbolism where the film cannot r i v a l h i m .
A n o t h e r facet o f the sheer q u a n t i t y o f data possible i n a movie
shot is exemplified i n historical films like Henry V or Richard HI.
H e r e extensive research w e n t i n t o the making o f the sets and
costumes that any six-year-old can n o w enjoy as readily as any
adult. T . S. E l i o t reported h o w , i n the m a k i n g of the film of his
Murder in the Cathedral, i t was n o t o n l y necessary t o have costumes o f the period, but—so great is the precision and t y r a n n y
o f the camera eye—these costumes had t o be w o v e n b y the same
techniques as those used i n the t w e l f t h century. H o l l y w o o d ,
amidst m u c h illusion, had also t o provide authentic scholarly
replicas of many past scenes. T h e stage and T V can make do w i t h
v e r y r o u g h approximations, because t h e y offer an image o f l o w
definition that evades detailed scrutiny.
A t first, however, i t was the detailed realism o f writers like
Dickens that inspired movie pioneers like D . W . Griffiths, w h o
carried a c o p y o f a Dickens novel on location. T h e realistic novel,

Movies/'289
that arose w i t h the newspaper f o r m o f communal cross-section
and human-interest coverage i n the eighteenth century, was a
complete anticipation o f film f o r m . Even the poets t o o k u p the
same panoramic style, w i t h human interest vignettes and close-ups
as variant. Gray's Elegy, Burns' The Cotter's Saturday
Night,
W o r d s w o r t h ' s Michael, and Byron's Childe Harold are all like
shooting scripts f o r some contemporary documentary film.
" T h e kettle began i t . . . ." Such is the opening o f Dickens'
Cricket and the Hearth. I f the modern novel came out of Gogol's
The Overcoat, the m o d e r n movie, says Eisenstein, boiled u p out o f
that kettle. I t should be plain that the A m e r i c a n and even British
approach t o film is m u c h lacking i n that free interplay among
the senses and the media that seems so natural t o Eisenstein or
René Clair. For the Russian, especially, i t is easy t o approach any
situation structurally, w h i c h is to say, sculpturally. T o Eisenstein,
the overwhelming fact o f film was that i t is an "act of juxtaposit i o n . " B u t t o a culture i n an extreme reach of typographic condit i o n i n g , the juxtaposition must be one of u n i f o r m and connected
characters and qualities. T h e r e must be no leaps f r o m the unique
space o f the tea kettle to the unique space o f the k i t t e n or the boot.
I f such objects appear, t h e y must be leveled off b y some c o n t i n u ous narrative, or be "contained" i n some u n i f o r m pictorial space.
A l l that Salvador D a l i had t o do to create a f u r o r was t o allow the

objects f r o m the u n i f o r m continuous space o f t y p o g r a p h y w e g o t
m o d e r n art and poetry. W e can measure the psychic pressure o f
t y p o g r a p h y b y the uproar generated b y that release. F o r most
people, their o w n ego image seems t o have been typographically
conditioned, so that the electric age w i t h its r e t u r n t o inclusive
experience threatens their idea o f self. These are the fragmented
ones, f o r w h o m specialist t o i l renders the mere prospect of leisure or
jobless security a nightmare. Electric simultaneity ends specialist
learning and activity, and demands interrelation i n depth, even
o f the personality.
T h e case of Charlie Chaplin films helps t o illumine this
problem. H i s Modern Times was taken t o be a satire o n the

290/Understanding Media
fragmented character o f modern tasks. A s c l o w n , Chaplin presents
the acrobatic feat i n a mime of elaborate incompetence, f o r any
specialist task leaves o u t most o f our faculties. T h e c l o w n reminds
us o f our fragmented state b y t a c k l i n g acrobatic or special jobs
i n the spirit of the w h o l e or integral man. T h i s is the f o r m u l a
f o r helpless incompetence. O n the street, i n social situations,
o n the assembly line, the w o r k e r continues his compulsive t w i t c h ings w i t h an imaginary w r e n c h . B u t the mime of this Chaplin film
and others is precisely that o f the r o b o t , the mechanical doll
whose deep pathos i t is t o approximate so closely t o the condition
o f human life. Chaplin, i n all his w o r k , d i d a puppetlike ballet of
the Cyrano de Bergerac k i n d . I n order t o capture this puppetlike
pathos, Chaplin (a devotee of ballet and personal f r i e n d o f Pavlova) adopted f r o m the first the f o o t postures o f classical ballet.
T h u s he could have the aura o f Spectre de la Rose shimmering
around his c l o w n getup. F r o m the British music hall, his first
training ground, w i t h a sure t o u c h o f genius he t o o k images like
that o f M r . Charles Pooter, the haunting figure o f a n o b o d y . T h i s
shoddy-genteel image he invested w i t h an envelope o f f a i r y r o mance b y means o f adherence t o the classic ballet postures. T h e
n e w film f o r m was perfectly adapted t o this composite image,
since film is itself a j e r k y mechanical ballet o f flicks that yields a
sheer dream w o r l d o f romantic illusions. B u t the film f o r m is not
just a puppetlike dance o f arrested still shots, f o r i t manages t o
approximate and even t o surpass real life b y means o f illusion.
T h a t is w h y Chaplin, i n his silent pictures at least, was never
tempted to abandon the Cyrano role o f the puppet w h o could
never really be a lover. I n this stereotype Chaplin discovered
the heart o f the film illusion, and he manipulated that heart w i t h
easy mastery, as the key t o the pathos o f a mechanized civilization.
A mechanized w o r l d is always i n the process o f getting ready t o
live, and to this end i t brings t o bear the most appalling p o m p of
skill and method and resourcefulness.
T h e film pushed this mechanism t o the utmost mechanical
verge and beyond, i n t o a surrealism o f dreams that money can
b u y . N o t h i n g is more congenial t o the film f o r m than this pathos
o f superabundance and power that is the dower of a puppet f o r

w h o m they can never be real. T h i s is the key t o The Great Gatsby
that reaches its moment o f t r u t h w h e n Daisy breaks d o w n i n
contemplating Gatsby's superb collection of shirts. Daisy and
Gatsby live i n a tinsel w o r l d that is b o t h corrupted b y power, y e t
innocently pastoral i n its dreaming.
T h e movie is n o t o n l y a supreme expression of mechanism,
but paradoxically i t offers as p r o d u c t the most magical o f consumer commodities, namely dreams. I t is, therefore, n o t accidental
that the movie has excelled as a medium that offers poor people
roles o f riches and p o w e r beyond the dreams of avarice. I n the
chapter on T h e Photograph, i t was pointed o u t h o w the press
p h o t o i n particular had discouraged the really r i c h f r o m the paths
o f conspicuous consumption. T h e life o f display that the photo
had taken f r o m the r i c h , the movie gave t o the poor w i t h lavish
hand:
Oh, lucky, lucky me,
I shall live i n luxury,
For I've got a pocketful of dreams.
T h e H o l l y w o o d tycoons were not w r o n g i n acting on the as¬
sumption that movies gave the American i m m i g r a n t a means of
self-fulfillment w i t h o u t any delay. T h i s strategy, however deplorable i n the light o f the "absolute ideal g o o d , " was perfectly i n
accord w i t h f i l m f o r m . I t meant that i n the 1920s the American
w a y o f life was exported t o the entire w o r l d i n cans. T h e w o r l d
eagerly lined up t o b u y canned dreams. T h e f i l m n o t o n l y accompanied the first great consumer age, b u t was also incentive, a d vertisement and, i n itself, a major c o m m o d i t y . N o w i n terms o l
media study i t is clear that the p o w e r of f i l m t o store i n f o r m a t i o n
i n accessible f o r m is unrivaled. A u d i o tape and video tape were t o

a major i n f o r m a t i o n resource, a rival o f the book whose techn o l o g y i t d i d so m u c h t o continue and also t o surpass. A t the
present time, film is still i n its manuscript phase, as i t were; shortly

separation o f functions that is n o w ending w i t h the electrical

T y p o g r a p h i c man t o o k readily t o f i l m just because, like
books, i t offers an i n w a r d w o r l d o f fantasy and dreams. T h e
f i l m viewer sits i n psychological solitude like the silent book
reader. T h i s was n o t the case w i t h the manuscript reader, nor
is i t true o f the watcher of television. I t is not pleasant t o t u r n
on T V just f o r oneself i n a hotel r o o m , nor even at home. T h e
T V mosaic image demands social completion and dialogue. So
w i t h the manuscript before t y p o g r a p h y , since manuscript culture
is oral and demands dialogue and debate, as the entire culture
o f the ancient and medieval w o r l d s demonstrates. One of the
major pressures o f T V has been t o encourage the "teaching
machine." I n fact, these devices are adaptations of the book i n
the direction o f dialogue. These teaching machines are really
private tutors, and their being misnamed o n the principle that
produced the names "wireless" and "horseless carriage" is another
instance i n that l o n g list that illustrates h o w every innovation
must pass t h r o u g h a p r i m a r y phase i n w h i c h the n e w effect is
secured b y the o l d method, amplified or modified b y some new
feature.
F i l m is n o t really a single m e d i u m like song or the w r i t t e n
w o r d , b u t a collective art f o r m w i t h different individuals directing
color, lighting, sound, acting, speaking. T h e press, radio and T V ,
and the comics are also art forms dependent u p o n entire teams and
hierarchies of skill i n corporate action. Prior to the movies, the
most obvious example o f such corporate artistic action had
occurred early i n the industrialized w o r l d , w i t h the large n e w s y m p h o n y orchestras of the nineteenth century. Paradoxically, as
industry w e n t its ever more specialized fragmented course, i t
demanded more and more t e a m w o r k i n sales and supplies. T h e
symphony orchestra became a major expression o f the ensuing
p o w e r o f such coordinated effort, t h o u g h f o r the players themselves this effect was lost, b o t h i n the symphony and i n industry.

Movies/293
W h e n the magazine editors recently introduced film scenario
procedures to the constructing of idea articles, the idea article
supplanted the short story. T h e film is the rival of the book i n
that sense. ( T V i n t u r n is the rival of the magazine because o f
its mosaic power.) Ideas presented as a sequence of shots or
pictorialized situations, almost i n the manner o f a teaching machine, actually drove the short story out of the magazine field.
H o l l y w o o d has f o u g h t T V mainly b y becoming a subsidiary
o f T V . Most o f the film industry is n o w engaged i n supplying
T V programs. B u t one n e w strategy has been tried, namely the
big-budget picture. T h e fact is that Technicolor is the closest
the movie can get t o the effect of the T V image. Technicolor
greatly lowers photographic intensity and creates, i n part, the
visual conditions f o r participant v i e w i n g . H a d H o l l y w o o d understood the reasons f o r Marty's success, T V m i g h t have given us
a r e v o l u t i o n i n film. Marty was a T V show that got onto the
screen i n the f o r m o f l o w definition or low-intensity visual
realism. I t was n o t a success story, and i t had no stars, because
the low-intensity T V image is quite incompatible w i t h the
high-intensity star image. Marty, w h i c h i n fact looked like an
early silent movie or an o l d Russian picture, offered the film
i n d u s t r y all the clues i t needed f o r meeting the T V challenge.
T h i s k i n d of casual, cool realism has given the new British
films easy ascendancy. Room at the Top features the n e w c o o l
realism. N o t o n l y is i t n o t a success story, i t is as m u c h an announcement of the end o f the Cinderella package as M a r i l y n
M o n r o e was the end o f the star system. Room at the Top is the
story o f h o w the higher a m o n k e y climbs, the more y o u see o f
his backside. T h e moral is that success is n o t o n l y w i c k e d b u t
also the formula f o r misery. I t is v e r y hard f o r a hot m e d i u m
like film t o accept the cool message of T V . B u t the Peter Sellers
movies Vm All Right, Jack and Only Two Can Play are perfectly
i n tune w i t h the n e w temper created b y the cool T V image.
Such is also the meaning of the ambiguous success o f
Lolita.
A s a novel, its acceptance announced the antiheroic approach
to romance. T h e film industry had l o n g beaten out a r o y a l road
to romance i n keeping w i t h the crescendo o f the success story.

294/Understanding

Media

Lolita announced that the r o y a l road was o n l y a cowtrack, after
all, and as f o r success, i t shouldn't happen t o a dog.
I n the ancient w o r l d and i n medieval times, the most popular
of all stories were those dealing w i t h The Falls of Princes. W i t h
the coming of the v e r y hot p r i n t medium, the preference changed
t o a rising r h y t h m and to tales o f success and sudden elevation i n
the w o r l d . I t seemed possible t o achieve anything b y the new
typographic method of minute, u n i f o r m segmentation o f p r o b lems. I t was b y this method, eventually, that film was made.
F i l m was, as a f o r m , the final f u l f i l l m e n t of the great potential
o f typographic fragmentation. B u t the electric implosion has n o w
reversed the entire process of expansion b y fragmentation. Elect r i c i t y has b r o u g h t back the cool, mosaic w o r l d o f implosion,
equilibrium, and stasis. I n our electric age, the one-way expansion
of the berserk individual o n his w a y t o the t o p n o w appears as a
gruesome image o f trampled lives and disrupted harmonies. Such
is the subliminal message of the T V mosaic w i t h its total field of
simultaneous impulses. F i l m strip and sequence cannot b u t b o w
t o this superior power. O u r o w n youngsters have taken the T V
message to heart i n their beatnik rejection o f consumer mores and
o f the private success story.
Since the best w a y t o get t o the core of a f o r m is t o study
its effect i n some unfamiliar setting, let us note w h a t President
Sukarno of Indonesia announced i n 1956 t o a large group of
H o l l y w o o d executives. H e said that he regarded them as political
radicals and revolutionaries w h o had greatly hastened political
change i n the East. W h a t the O r i e n t saw i n a H o l l y w o o d movie
was a w o r l d i n w h i c h all the ordinary people had cars and electric
stoves and refrigerators. So the Oriental n o w regards himself as an
ordinary person w h o has been deprived o f the o r d i n a r y man's
birthright.
T h a t is another w a y of getting a v i e w of the film medium as
monster ad f o r consumer goods. I n America this major aspect
o f film is merely subliminal. Far f r o m regarding our pictures
as incentives t o mayhem and revolution, w e take them as solace
and compensation, or as a f o r m o f deferred payment b y daydreaming. But the Oriental is r i g h t , and w e are w r o n g about this.

Movies/295
I n fact, the movie is a m i g h t y l i m b o f the industrial giant. T h a t i t
is being amputated b y the T V image reflects a still greater r e v o l u t i o n going on at the center of A m e r i c a n life. I t is natural that the
ancient East should feel the political p u l l and industrial challenge
o f o u r movie industry. T h e movie, as m u c h as the alphabet and
the printed w o r d , is an aggressive and imperial f o r m that explodes o u t w a r d i n t o other cultures. Its explosive force was
significantly greater i n silent pictures than i n talkies, f o r the
electromagnetic sound track already forecast the substitution o f
electric implosion f o r mechanical explosion. T h e silent pictures
were immediately acceptable across language barriers as the
talkies were not. Radio teamed u p w i t h f i l m t o give us the
talkie and to carry us f u r t h e r on our present reverse course o f
implosion or re-integration after the mechanical age of explosion
and expansion. T h e extreme f o r m of this implosion or contract i o n is the image o f the astronaut locked into his wee b i t o f
wraparound space. Far f r o m enlarging our w o r l d , he is announci n g its contraction t o village size. T h e rocket and the space
capsule are ending the rule o f the wheel and the machine, as
m u c h as d i d the w i r e services, radio, and T V .
W e may n o w consider a f u r t h e r instance of the film's i n fluence i n a most conclusive aspect. I n m o d e r n literature there
is probably no more celebrated technique than that of the stream
o f consciousness or interior monologue. W h e t h e r i n Proust, Joyce,
or E l i o t , this f o r m o f sequence permits the reader an extraordinary
indentification w i t h personalities of the utmost range and diversity.
T h e stream o f consciousness is really managed b y the transfer o f
f i l m technique t o the p r i n t e d page, where, i n a deep sense i t really
originated; f o r as w e have seen, the Gutenberg technology o f
movable types is quite indispensable t o any industrial o r film
process. A s m u c h as the infinitesimal calculus that pretends t o deal
w i t h m o t i o n and change b y minute fragmentation, the film does
so b y m a k i n g m o t i o n and change i n t o a series o f static shots.
P r i n t does likewise w h i l e pretending t o deal w i t h the w h o l e m i n d
i n action. Y e t film and the stream o f consciousness alike seemed
to provide a deeply desired release f r o m the mechanical w o r l d

I n 1911 H e n r i Bergson i n Creative Evolution

o f consciousness, or interior f i l m t o obtain release into a w o r l d
of spontaneity, o f dreams, and o f unique personal experience.
Dickens perhaps began i t all w i t h his M r . Jingle i n
Pickwick
Papers. Certainly i n David Copperfield he made a great technical
discovery, since f o r the first time the w o r l d unfolds realistically
t h r o u g h the use o f the eyes of a g r o w i n g child as camera. Here
was the stream o f consciousness, perhaps, i n its original f o r m
before i t was adopted b y Proust and Joyce and E l i o t . I t indicates
h o w the enrichment o f human experience can occur unexpectedly
w i t h the crossing and interplay o f the life of media forms.

England and America had had their "shots"
against radio i n the f o r m of l o n g exposure
t o literacy and industrialism. These forms
involve an intense visual organization of
experience. T h e more earthy and less visual
European cultures were n o t immune t o
radio. Its tribal magic was not lost on them,
and the o l d web o f kinship began t o resonate once more w i t h the note of fascism.
T h e inability of literate people t o grasp the
language and message o f the media as such
is i n v o l u n t a r i l y conveyed b y the comments
o f sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld i n discussing
the effects of radio:
The last group of effects may be
called the monopolistic effects of radio.
Such have attracted most public attention because of their importance i n the
totalitarian countries. I f a government
monopolizes the radio, then by mere
repetition and by exclusion of conflicting points of view i t can determine the
opinions of the population. W e do not
know much about how this monopo-

298/Understanding

listic effect really works, but i t is important to note its singularity. N o inference should be drawn regarding the effects of
radio as such. I t is often forgotten that H i t l e r did not achieve
control through radio but almost despite i t , because at the
time of his rise to power radio was controlled by his enemies.
The monopolistic effects have probably less social importance
than is generally assumed.
Professor Lazarsfeld's helpless unawareness o f the nature and
effects o f radio is n o t a personal defect, b u t a universally shared
ineptitude.
I n a radio speech i n M u n i c h , M a r c h 14, 1936, H i t l e r said,
" I go m y w a y w i t h the assurance o f a somnambulist." H i s victims
and his critics have been equally somnambulistic. T h e y danced
entranced t o the t r i b a l d r u m o f radio that extended their central
nervous system t o create depth involvement f o r everybody. " I
live r i g h t inside radio w h e n I listen. I more easily lose myself i n
radio than i n a b o o k , " said a voice f r o m a radio p o l l . T h e power of
radio t o involve people i n depth is manifested i n its use d u r i n g
h o m e w o r k b y youngsters and b y m a n y other people w h o carry
transistor sets i n order to provide a private w o r l d f o r themselves
amidst crowds. T h e r e is a little poem b y the German dramatist
Berthold Brecht:
You little box, held to me when escaping
So that your valves should not break,
Carried f r o m house to ship f r o m ship to train,
So that my enemies might go on talking to me
Near m y bed, to m y pain
The last thing at night, the first thing i n the morning,
O f their victories and of m y cares,
Promise me not to go silent all of a sudden.
One o f the many effects o f television on radio has been t o
shift radio f r o m an entertainment m e d i u m i n t o a k i n d o f nervous
i n f o r m a t i o n system. N e w s bulletins, time signals, traffic data, and,
above all, weather reports n o w serve t o enhance the native power
o f radio t o involve people i n one another. Weather is that medium
that involves all people equally. I t is the t o p i t e m o n radio,
showering us w i t h fountains o f a u d i t o r y space or
lebensraum.

w h a t had happened. T V is a cool m e d i u m . I t rejects h o t figures

N i x o n ' s fate to provide a sharp, high-definition image and action
f o r the cool T V m e d i u m that translated that sharp image i n t o the
impression o f a p h o n y . I suppose " p h o n y " is something that resonates w r o n g , that doesn't ring true. I t m i g h t w e l l be that F . D . R .

Radio affects most people intimately, person-to-person, off e r i n g a w o r l d o f unspoken communication between w r i t e r speaker and the listener. T h a t is the immediate aspect o f radio.
A private experience. T h e subliminal depths o f radio are charged

T h a t H i t l e r came i n t o political existence at all is d i r e c t l y o w i n g
t o radio and public-address systems. T h i s is n o t t o say that these
media relayed his thoughts effectively t o the German people.
H i s thoughts were o f v e r y little consequence. Radio provided
the first massive experience of electronic implosion, that reversal
o f the entire direction and meaning o f literate W e s t e r n civilizat i o n . For tribal peoples, f o r those whose entire social existence is
an extension o f f a m i l y life, radio w i l l continue t o be a violent
experience. H i g h l y literate societies, that have l o n g subordinated
f a m i l y life to individualist stress i n business and politics, have
managed to absorb and to neutralize the radio implosion w i t h o u t
revolution. N o t so, those communities that have had o n l y brief
or superficial experience o f literacy. F o r them, radio is u t t e r l y
explosive.
T o understand such effects, i t is necessary to see literacy as
typographic technology, applied n o t o n l y t o the rationalizing o f
the entire procedures o f p r o d u c t i o n and marketing, b u t t o law
and education and c i t y planning, as w e l l . T h e principles o f cont i n u i t y , u n i f o r m i t y , and repeatability derived f r o m p r i n t technolo g y have, i n England and America, l o n g permeated every phase
o f communal life. I n those areas a c h i l d learns literacy f r o m
traffic and street, f r o m every car and t o y and garment. Learning
t o read and w r i t e is a m i n o r facet of literacy i n the u n i f o r m , c o n tinuous environments o f the English-speaking w o r l d . Stress o n
literacy is a distinguishing mark o f areas that are striving t o initiate
that process o f standardization that leads t o the visual organization
o f w o r k and space. W i t h o u t psychic transformation o f the inner
l i f e i n t o segmented visual terms b y literacy, there cannot be the
economic " t a k e - o f f " that insures a continual movement o f augmented p r o d u c t i o n and perpetually accelerated change-and-exchange o f goods and services.
Just p r i o r to 1914, the Germans had become obsessed w i t h
the menace of "encirclement." T h e i r neighbors had all developed
elaborate r a i l w a y systems that facilitated mobilization o f manp o w e r resources. Encirclement is a h i g h l y visual image that had

Radio/301
great novelty f o r this n e w l y industrialized nation. I n the 1930s,
b y contrast, the German obsession was w i t h lebensraum. T h i s is
not a visual concern, at all. I t is a claustrophobia, engendered b y
the radio implosion and compression o f space. T h e German defeat
had thrust them back f r o m visual obsession i n t o b r o o d i n g u p o n the
resonating A f r i c a w i t h i n . T h e t r i b a l past has never ceased t o be a
reality f o r the German psyche.
I t was the ready access o f the German and middle-European
w o r l d t o the r i c h nonvisual resources of a u d i t o r y and tactile f o r m
that enabled them t o enrich the w o r l d o f music and dance and
sculpture. A b o v e all their t r i b a l mode gave them easy access t o the
new nonvisual w o r l d o f subatomic physics, i n w h i c h long-literate
and long-industrialized societies are decidedly handicapped. T h e
r i c h area o f preliterate v i t a l i t y felt the h o t impact of radio. T h e
message o f radio is one o f violent, unified implosion and resonance.
For A f r i c a , India, China, and even Russia, radio is a p r o f o u n d
archaic force, a time b o n d w i t h the most ancient past and l o n g f o r g o t t e n experience.
T r a d i t i o n , i n a w o r d , is the sense o f the total past as now.
Its awakening is a natural result o f radio impact and of electric
i n f o r m a t i o n , i n general. F o r the intensely literate population,
however, radio engendered a p r o f o u n d unrealizable sense o f
g u i l t that sometimes expressed itself i n the fellow-traveler attitude.
A n e w l y f o u n d human involvement bred anxiety and insecurity
and unpredictability. Since literacy had fostered an extreme of i n dividualism, and radio had done just the opposite i n reviving the
ancient experience of kinship webs of deep t r i b a l involvement, the
literate W e s t t r i e d to f i n d some sort of compromise i n a larger sense
o f collective responsibility. T h e sudden impulse t o this end was
just as subliminal and obscure as the earlier l i t e r a r y pressure t o w a r d
individual isolation and irresponsibility; therefore, nobody was
happy about any o f the positions arrived at. T h e Gutenberg techn o l o g y had produced a new k i n d of visual, national entity i n the
sixteenth century that was gradually meshed w i t h industrial p r o d u c t i o n and expansion. Telegraph and radio neutralized nationalism b u t evoked archaic t r i b a l ghosts of the most vigorous brand.

sion, or as Joyce puts i t i n the Wake, " I n that earopean end

the open society and reintroduced the Indie w o r l d of t r i b a l man

c r y p t i c , as i n dramatic and mimetic, f o r m . T h e reader has o n l y
t o take any o f his phrases such as this one, and mime i t u n t i l i t
yields the intelligible. N o t a l o n g or tedious process, i f approached
i n the spirit o f artistic playfulness that guarantees "lots o f f u n at
Finnegan's w a k e . "
Radio is provided w i t h its cloak o f invisibility, like any other
medium. I t comes t o us ostensibly w i t h person-to-person directness
that is private and intimate, w h i l e i n more urgent fact, i t is really a
subliminal echo chamber of magical power t o t o u c h remote and
f o r g o t t e n chords. A l l technological extensions o f ourselves must
be numb and subliminal, else w e c o u l d n o t endure the leverage
exerted u p o n us b y such extension. Even more than telephone or
telegraph, radio is that extension o f the central nervous system that
is matched o n l y b y human speech itself. Is i t n o t w o r t h y of our
meditation that radio should be specially attuned t o that p r i m i t i v e
extension o f our central nervous system, that aboriginal mass
medium, the vernacular tongue? T h e crossing of these t w o most
intimate and potent o f human technologies could n o t possibly
have failed t o provide some extraordinary new shapes f o r human
experience. So i t proved w i t h H i t l e r , the somnambulist. B u t does
the detribalized and literate W e s t imagine that i t has earned i m m u n i t y t o the tribal magic o f radio as a permanent possession?
O u r teenagers i n the 1950s began t o manifest many o f the tribal
stigmata. T h e adolescent, as opposed t o the teenager, can n o w be
classified as a phenomenon o f literacy. Is i t n o t significant that the
adolescent was indigenous o n l y t o those areas o f England and
America where literacy had invested even f o o d w i t h abstract visual
values? Europe never had adolescents. I t had chaperones. N o w ,
to the teenager, radio gives privacy, and at the same time i t p r o vides the t i g h t tribal b o n d of the w o r l d o f the c o m m o n market,
o f song, and of resonance. T h e ear is hyperesthetic compared t o
the neutral eye. T h e ear is intolerant, closed, and exclusive, whereas the eye is open, neutral, and associative. Ideas of tolerance came

Radio/303
to the W e s t o n l y after t w o or three centuries o f literacy and visual
Gutenberg culture. N o such saturation w i t h visual values had
occurred i n Germany b y 1930. Russia is still far f r o m any such
involvement w i t h visual order and values.
I f w e sit and talk i n a dark r o o m , w o r d s suddenly acquire
new meanings and different textures. T h e y become richer, even,
than architecture, w h i c h L e Corbusier r i g h t l y says can best be f e l t
at n i g h t . A l l those gestural qualities that the printed page strips
f r o m language come back i n the dark, and o n the radio. G i v e n o n l y
the sound o f a play, w e have t o f i l l i n all o f the senses, n o t just the
sight o f the action. So m u c h do-it-yourself, or completion and
"closure" o f action, develops a k i n d of independent isolation i n
the y o u n g that makes them remote and inaccessible. T h e mystic
screen o f sound w i t h w h i c h they are invested b y their radios
provides the privacy f o r their h o m e w o r k , and i m m u n i t y f r o m
parental behest.
W i t h radio came great changes t o the press, t o advertising, t o
drama, and t o poetry. Radio offered new scope t o practical jokers
like M o r t o n D o w n e y at CBS. A sportscaster had just begun his
fifteen-minute reading f r o m a script w h e n he was joined b y M r .
D o w n e y , w h o proceeded t o remove his shoes and socks. N e x t
f o l l o w e d coat and trousers and then underwear, w h i l e the sportscaster helplessly continued his broadcast, testifying t o the c o m pelling power o f the mike t o command l o y a l t y over modesty
and the self-protective impulse.
Radio created the disk jockey, and elevated the gag w r i t e r
i n t o a major national role. Since the advent o f radio, the gag has
supplanted the joke, n o t because o f gag writers, b u t because radio
is a fast hot medium that has also rationed the reporter's space f o r
stories.
Jean Shepherd o f W O R i n N e w Y o r k regards radio as a n e w
m e d i u m f o r a new k i n d o f novel that he writes n i g h t l y . T h e m i k e
is his pen and paper. H i s audience and their knowledge o f the daily
events o f the w o r l d provide his characters, his scenes, and moods.
I t is his idea that, just as Montaigne was the first t o use the page
t o r e c o r d his reactions t o the new w o r l d o f p r i n t e d books, he is
the first to use radio as an essay and novel f o r m f o r recording our

304/Understanding

Media

c o m m o n awareness o f a t o t a l l y new w o r l d of universal human
participation i n all human events, private or collective.
T o the student o f media, i t is difficult t o explain the human
indifference t o social effects o f these radical forces. T h e phonetic
alphabet and the p r i n t e d w o r d that exploded the closed tribal
w o r l d into the open society o f fragmented functions and specialist
knowledge and action have never been studied i n their roles as a
magical transformer. T h e antithetic electric power o f instant i n f o r m a t i o n that reverses social explosion i n t o implosion, private
enterprise into organization man, and expanding empires i n t o
c o m m o n markets, has obtained as little recognition as the w r i t t e n
w o r d . T h e p o w e r of radio t o retribalize mankind, its almost instant
reversal o f individualism i n t o collectivism, Fascist or Marxist, has
gone unnoticed. So extraordinary is this unawareness that it is w h a t
needs t o be explained. T h e transforming p o w e r o f media is easy
t o explain, b u t the i g n o r i n g o f this p o w e r is n o t at all easy t o explain. I t goes w i t h o u t saying that the universal i g n o r i n g of the
psychic action o f technology bespeaks some inherent f u n c t i o n ,
some essential n u m b i n g o f consciousness such as occurs under
stress and shock conditions.
T h e history o f radio is instructive as an indicator o f the bias
and blindness induced i n any society b y its pre-existent technology. T h e w o r d "wireless," still used f o r radio i n Britain, manifests
the negative "horseless-carriage" attitude t o w a r d a n e w f o r m .
E a r l y wireless was regarded as a f o r m of telegraph, and was n o t
seen even i n relation t o the telephone. D a v i d Sarnoff i n 1916 sent
a memo to the D i r e c t o r of the A m e r i c a n M a r c o n i Company that
employed h i m , advocating the idea o f a music box i n the home.
I t was ignored. T h a t was the year o f the Irish Easter rebellion
and o f the first radio broadcast. Wireless had already been used
o n ships as ship-to-shore "telegraph." T h e Irish rebels used a
ship's wireless t o make, not a p o i n t - t o - p o i n t message, b u t a diffused
broadcast i n the hope of getting w o r d t o some ship that w o u l d
relay their story t o the American press. A n d so i t proved. Even
after broadcasting had been i n existence f o r some years, there was
no commercial interest i n i t . I t was the amateur operators or hams
and their fans, whose petitions finally g o t some action i n favor of the

Radio/305
setting u p o f facilities. T h e r e was reluctance and opposition f r o m
the w o r l d o f the press, w h i c h , i n England, led t o the f o r m a t i o n
of the B B C and the firm shackling o f radio b y newspaper and
advertising interests. T h i s is an obvious r i v a l r y that has n o t been
openly discussed. T h e restrictive pressure b y the press o n radio
and T V is still a h o t issue i n Britain and i n Canada. But, t y p i c a l l y ,
misunderstanding o f the nature o f the m e d i u m rendered the r e straining policies quite futile. Such has always been the case, most
notoriously i n government censorship o f the press and o f the
movies. A l t h o u g h the m e d i u m is the message, the controls go
b e y o n d programming. T h e restraints are always directed t o the
" c o n t e n t , " w h i c h is always another m e d i u m . T h e content o f the
press is literary statement, as the content o f the book is speech, and
the content of the movie is the novel. So the effects o f radio are
quite independent o f its p r o g r a m m i n g . T o those w h o have never
studied media, this fact is quite as baffling as literacy is t o natives,
w h o say, " W h y do y o u write? Can't y o u remember?"
T h u s , the commercial interests w h o t h i n k t o render media
universally acceptable, invariably settle f o r "entertainment" as a
strategy o f neutrality. A more spectacular mode o f the ostrichhead-in-sand could n o t be devised, f o r i t ensures maximal pervasiveness f o r any m e d i u m whatever. T h e literate c o m m u n i t y w i l l
always argue f o r a controversial or p o i n t - o f - v i e w use o f press,
radio, and movie that w o u l d i n effect diminish the operation, n o t
o n l y o f press, radio and movie, b u t of the book as w e l l . T h e
commercial entertainment strategy automatically ensures maxim u m speed and force o f impact f o r any m e d i u m , o n psychic and
social life equally. I t thus becomes a comic strategy of u n w i t t i n g
self-liquidation, conducted b y those w h o are dedicated t o permanence, rather than t o change. I n the f u t u r e , the o n l y effective media
controls must take the thermostatic f o r m o f quantitative rationing.
Just as w e n o w t r y t o c o n t r o l atom-bomb fallout, so w e w i l l one
day t r y t o control media fallout. Education w i l l become recognized as c i v i l defense against media fallout. T h e o n l y medium
f o r w h i c h our education n o w offers some c i v i l defense is the p r i n t
medium. T h e educational establishment, f o u n d e d o n p r i n t , does
not y e t admit any other responsibilities.

Radio provides a speed-up o f i n f o r m a t i o n that also causes
acceleration i n other media. I t certainly contracts the w o r l d t o
village size, and creates insatiable village tastes f o r gossip, r u m o r ,
and personal malice. B u t w h i l e radio contracts the w o r l d t o village
dimensions, i t hasn't the effect o f homogenizing the village quarters. Q u i t e the c o n t r a r y . I n India, where radio is the supreme f o r m
o f communication, there are more than a dozen official languages
and the same number o f official radio networks. T h e effect o f
radio as a reviver o f archaism and ancient memories is n o t limited
t o H i t l e r ' s Germany. Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have undergone
resurgence o f their ancient tongues since the coming o f radio, and
the Israeli present an even more extreme instance o f linguistic
revival. T h e y n o w speak a language w h i c h has been dead i n books
f o r centuries. Radio is n o t o n l y a m i g h t y awakener o f archaic
memories, forces, and animosities, b u t a decentralizing, pluralistic
force, as is really the case w i t h all electric power and media.
Centralism o f organization is based o n the continuous, visual,
lineal structuring that arises f r o m phonetic literacy. A t first, therefore, electric media merely f o l l o w e d the established patterns o f
literate structures. Radio was released f r o m these centralist netw o r k pressures b y T V . T V then t o o k u p the burden o f centralism,
f r o m w h i c h i t may be released b y Telstar. W i t h T V accepting the
central n e t w o r k burden derived f r o m our centralized industrial
organization, radio was free t o diversify, and t o begin a regional
and local c o m m u n i t y service that i t had n o t k n o w n , even i n the
earliest days of the radio "hams." Since T V , radio has t u r n e d t o
the individual needs o f people at different times of the day, a fact
that goes w i t h the m u l t i p l i c i t y of receiving sets i n bedrooms,
bathrooms, kitchens, cars, and n o w i n pockets. D i f f e r e n t programs
are provided f o r those engaged i n divers activities. Radio, once a
f o r m o f g r o u p listening that emptied churches, has reverted t o
private and individual uses since T V . T h e teenager w i t h d r a w s
f r o m the T V g r o u p t o his private radio.
T h i s natural bias o f radio t o a close tie-in w i t h diversified
c o m m u n i t y groups is best manifested i n the disk-jockey cults, and
i n radio's use of the telephone i n a glorified f o r m o f the o l d t r u n k line w i r e - t a p p i n g . Plato, w h o had old-fashioned tribal ideas o f

Radio/307
political structure, said that the proper size o f a c i t y was indicated
b y the number o f people w h o could hear the voice of a public
speaker. Even the p r i n t e d book, let alone radio, renders the
political assumptions o f Plato quite irrelevant f o r practical p u r poses. Y e t radio, because o f its ease of decentralized intimate relation w i t h b o t h private and small communities, c o u l d easily implement the Platonic political dream on a w o r l d scale.
T h e u n i t i n g o f radio w i t h phonograph that constitutes the
average radio program yields a v e r y special pattern quite superior
i n p o w e r to the combination of radio and telegraph press that
yields our news and weather programs. I t is curious h o w m u c h
more arresting are the weather reports than the news, o n b o t h
radio and T V . Is n o t this because "weather" is n o w entirely an
electronic f o r m of i n f o r m a t i o n , whereas news retains m u c h of the
pattern o f the p r i n t e d word? I t is probably the p r i n t and book bias
o f the BBC and the CBC that renders them so a w k w a r d and i n hibited i n radio and T V presentation. Commercial urgency, rather
than artistic insight, fostered b y contrast a hectic v i v a c i t y i n the
corresponding A m e r i c a n operation.

Perhaps the most familiar and pathetic effect o f the T V image is the posture of

creative and modest performer. A f e w t i m e l y touches like this
w o u l d have quite altered the result o f the K e n n e d y - N i x o n campaign. T V is a m e d i u m that rejects the sharp personality and
favors the presentation of processes rather than o f products.
T h e adaptation o f T V to processes, rather than t o the neatly
packaged products, explains the f r u s t r a t i o n many people experience w i t h this m e d i u m i n its political uses. A n article b y
E d i t h E f r o n i n TV Guide ( M a y 18-24, 1963) labeled T V " T h e
T i m i d G i a n t , " because i t is unsuited to h o t issues and sharply
defined controversal topics: "Despite official freedom f r o m censorship, a self-imposed silence renders n e t w o r k documentaries
almost mute on many great issues o f the d a y . " A s a cool m e d i u m
T V has, some feel, i n t r o d u c e d a k i n d of rigor mortis i n t o the b o d y
politic. I t is the extraordinary degree of audience participation i n
the T V medium that explains its failure t o tackle h o t issues*
H o w a r d K . Smith observed: " T h e networks are delighted i f y o u
go i n t o a controversy i n a c o u n t r y 14,000 miles away. T h e y don't
w a n t real controversy, real dissent, at home." F o r people c o n ditioned t o the h o t newspaper medium, w h i c h is concerned w i t h
the clash o f views, rather than involvement i n depth i n a situation,
the T V behavior is inexplicable.
Such a hot news i t e m that concerns T V d i r e c t l y was headlined " I t finally happened—a British f i l m w i t h English subtitles t o
explain the dialects." T h e f i l m i n question is the British comedy

"Sparrows D o n ' t Sing." A glossary o f Yorkshire, Cockney, and
other slang phrases has been p r i n t e d f o r the customers so that they
can figure o u t just w h a t the subtitles mean. Sub subtitles are as
handy an indicator o f the depth effects o f T V as the n e w " r u g g e d "
styles i n feminine attire. One o f the most extraordinary developments since T V i n England has been the upsurge o f regional
dialects. A regional brogue or " b u r r " is the vocal equivalent of
gaiter stockings. Such brogues undergo continual erosion f r o m
literacy. T h e i r sudden prominence i n England i n areas i n w h i c h
previously one had heard o n l y standard English is one o f the most
significant c u l t u r a l events o f our time. Even i n the classrooms of
O x f o r d and Cambridge, the local dialects are heard again. T h e
undergraduates o f those universities no longer strive t o achieve
a u n i f o r m speech. Dialectal speech since T V has been f o u n d t o
provide a social b o n d i n depth, n o t possible w i t h the artificial
"standard E n g l i s h " that began o n l y a c e n t u r y ago.
A n article o n P e r r y Como bills h i m as "Low-pressure k i n g of
a high-pressure realm." T h e success o f any T V performer depends
o n his achieving a low-pressure style of presentation, although
getting his act o n the air m a y require m u c h high-pressure organization. Castro may be a case i n p o i n t . A c c o r d i n g t o T a d
Szulc's story o n "Cuban Television's One-man S h o w "
(The
Eighth Art), " i n his seemingly improvised 'as-I-go-along' style he
can evolve politics and govern his c o u n t r y — r i g h t o n camera."
N o w , T a d Szulc is under the illusion that T V is a h o t medium,
and suggests that i n the Congo "television m i g h t have helped
L u m u m b a to incite the masses t o even greater t u r m o i l and
bloodshed." B u t he is quite w r o n g . Radio is the m e d i u m f o r frenzy,
and i t has been the major means o f h o t t i n g u p the t r i b a l b l o o d of
A f r i c a , India, and China, alike. T V has cooled Cuba d o w n , as i t is
cooling d o w n America. W h a t the Cubans are getting b y T V is
the experience o f being d i r e c t l y engaged i n the m a k i n g o f political
decisions. Castro presents himself as a teacher, and as Szulc says,
"manages t o blend political guidance and education w i t h p r o p aganda so s k i l l f u l l y that i t is o f t e n difficult t o t e l l where one
begins and the other ends." Exactly the same m i x is used i n entertainment i n Europe and America alike. Seen outside the U n i t e d

Television/311
States, any American movie looks like subtle political propaganda.
Acceptable entertainment has t o flatter and exploit the cultural
and political assumptions o f the land o f its origin. These unspoken
presuppositions also serve t o b l i n d people t o the most obvious facts
about a n e w medium like T V .
I n a g r o u p o f simulcasts o f several media done i n T o r o n t o a
f e w years back, T V d i d a strange flip. F o u r randomized groups
o f university students were given the same i n f o r m a t i o n at the
same time about the structure o f preliterate languages. One g r o u p
received i t via radio, one f r o m T V , one b y lecture, and one read
i t . F o r all b u t the reader g r o u p , the i n f o r m a t i o n was passed along
i n straight verbal flow b y the same speaker w i t h o u t discussion or
questions or use o f blackboard. Each g r o u p had half an hour o f
exposure t o the material. Each was asked t o fill i n the same quiz
afterward. I t was quite a surprise t o the experimenters w h e n the
students performed better w i t h T V - c h a n n e l e d i n f o r m a t i o n and
w i t h radio than they d i d w i t h lecture and print—and the T V
g r o u p stood well above the radio group. Since n o t h i n g had been
done t o give special stress t o any o f these f o u r media, the experiment was repeated w i t h other randomized groups. T h i s time each
m e d i u m was allowed f u l l o p p o r t u n i t y t o do its stuff. F o r radio
and T V , the material was dramatized w i t h m a n y a u d i t o r y and
visual features. T h e lecturer t o o k f u l l advantage of the blackboard
and class discussion. T h e p r i n t e d f o r m was embellished w i t h an
imaginative use o f t y p o g r a p h y and page layout t o stress each
p o i n t i n the lecture. A l l o f these media had been stepped u p t o
h i g h intensity f o r this repeat o f the original performance. Television and radio once again showed results high above lecture and
p r i n t . Unexpectedly t o the testers, however, radio n o w stood significantly above television. I t was a l o n g time before the obvious
reason declared itself, namely that T V is a cool, participant
medium. W h e n hotted u p b y dramatization and stingers, i t performs less w e l l because there is less o p p o r t u n i t y f o r participation.
Radio is a hot medium. W h e n given additional intensity, i t performs better. I t doesn't invite the same degree of participation i n
its users. Radio w i l l serve as background-sound or as noise-level

A great many things w i l l n o t w o r k since the arrival o f T V .
N o t o n l y the movies, b u t the national magazines as w e l l , have
been h i t v e r y hard b y this new m e d i u m . Even the comic books
have declined greatly. Before T V , there had been m u c h concern
about w h y J o h n n y couldn't read. Since T V , J o h n n y has acquired
an entirely new set of perceptions. H e is n o t at all the same. O t t o
Preminger, director o f Anatomy of a Murder and other hits, dates
a great change i n movie making and v i e w i n g f r o m the v e r y first
year o f general T V programming. " I n 1951," he w r o t e , " I started
a fight t o get the release i n m o t i o n - p i c t u r e theaters o f The
Moon
Is Blue after the p r o d u c t i o n code approval was refused. I t was a
small fight and I w o n i t . " (Toronto
Daily Star, October 19, 1963)
H e w e n t o n t o say, " T h e v e r y fact that i t was the w o r d
V i r g i n ' that was objected to i n The Moon Is Blue is today laughable, almost incredible." O t t o Preminger considers that A m e r i c a n
movies have advanced t o w a r d m a t u r i t y o w i n g t o the influence of
T V . T h e cool T V medium promotes depth structures i n art and
entertainment alike, and creates audience involvement i n depth as
w e l l . Since nearly all our technologies and entertainment since
Gutenberg have been n o t cool, b u t h o t ; and n o t deep, b u t f r a g mentary; n o t producer-oriented, b u t consumer-oriented, there is
scarcely a single area o f established relationships, f r o m home and
church to school and market, that has n o t been p r o f o u n d l y
disturbed i n its pattern and texture.
T h e psychic and social disturbance created b y the T V image,
and not the T V programming, occasions daily comment i n the
press. R a y m o n d Burr, w h o plays P e r r y Mason, spoke t o the
National Association o f M u n i c i p a l Judges, r e m i n d i n g t h e m that,
" W i t h o u t our laymen's understanding and acceptance, the laws
w h i c h y o u apply and the courts i n w h i c h y o u preside cannot continue to exist." W h a t M r . B u r r o m i t t e d to observe was that the
Perry Mason T V program, i n w h i c h he plays the lead, is t y p i c a l
o f that intensely participational k i n d o f T V experience that has
altered our relation t o the laws and the courts.
T h e mode o f the T V image has n o t h i n g i n c o m m o n w i t h film

Television/313
or photo, except that i t offers also a nonverbal gestalt or posture
o f forms. W i t h T V , the viewer is the screen. H e is bombarded w i t h
light impulses that James Joyce called the "Charge of the L i g h t
Brigade" that imbues his "soulskin w i t h sobconscious inklings."
T h e T V image is visually l o w i n data. T h e T V image is n o t a
ttill shot. I t is not photo i n any sense, b u t a ceaselessly f o r m i n g
contour of things limned b y the scanning-finger. T h e resulting
plastic contour appears b y l i g h t through, n o t light on, and the
image so f o r m e d has the q u a l i t y of sculpture and icon, rather than
o f picture. T h e T V image offers some three m i l l i o n dots per
second t o the receiver. F r o m these he accepts o n l y a f e w dozen
each instant, f r o m w h i c h t o make an image.
T h e f i l m image offers many more millions of data per second,
and the viewer does n o t have t o make the same drastic r e d u c t i o n
o f items t o f o r m his impression. H e tends instead to accept the f u l l
image as a package deal. I n contrast, the viewer of the T V mosaic,
w i t h technical c o n t r o l o f the image, unconsciously reconfigures
the dots into an abstract w o r k o f art on the pattern of a Seurat or
Rouault. I f anybody were t o ask whether all this w o u l d change
i f technology stepped u p the character o f the T V image t o movie
data level, one c o u l d o n l y counter b y i n q u i r i n g , " C o u l d w e alter

T h e answer is "Yes," o n l y i t w o u l d then no longer be a cartoon.
N o r w o u l d " i m p r o v e d " T V be television. T h e T V image is novo
a mosaic mesh of l i g h t and dark spots w h i c h a movie shot never is,
even w h e n the quality o f the movie image is v e r y poor.
A s i n any other mosaic, the t h i r d dimension is alien t o T V ,
b u t i t can be superimposed. I n T V the illusion of the t h i r d dimension is provided slightly b y the stage sets i n the studio; b u t the T V
image itself is a flat two-dimensional mosaic. Most o f the threedimensional illusion is a carry-over o f habitual v i e w i n g o f f i l m and
photo. For the T V camera does n o t have a b u i l t - i n angle o f vision
like the movie camera. Eastman K o d a k n o w has a t w o - d i m e n sional camera that can match the flat effects of the T V camera.

w o u l d n o t have made a mess o f motorcar design, and the picture
magazine w o u l d n o t be having difficulties n o w w i t h the relationship between features and ads. T h e T V image requires each i n stant that w e "close" the spaces i n the mesh b y a convulsive
sensuous participation that is p r o f o u n d l y kinetic and tactile,
because t a c t i l i t y is the interplay of the senses, rather than the isolated contact of skin and object.
T o contrast i t w i t h the film shot, m a n y directors refer to the
T V image as one o f " l o w d e f i n i t i o n , " i n the sense that i t offers
little detail and a l o w degree of i n f o r m a t i o n , m u c h like the cartoon.
A T V close-up provides o n l y as m u c h i n f o r m a t i o n as a small
section o f a long-shot o n the movie screen. F o r lack o f observing
so central an aspect o f the T V image, the critics of p r o g r a m " c o n t e n t " have talked nonsense about " T V violence." T h e spokesmen
o f censorious views are t y p i c a l l y semiliterate book-oriented i n d i viduals w h o have no competence i n the grammars of newspaper,
o r radio, or of film, b u t w h o l o o k askew and askance at all n o n book media. T h e simplest question about any psychic aspect,
even o f the book medium, t h r o w s these people i n t o a panic o f
uncertainty. Vehemence o f p r o j e c t i o n o f a single isolated attitude
t h e y mistake f o r m o r a l vigilance. Once these censors became aware
that i n all cases "the m e d i u m is the message" or the basic source o f
effects, t h e y w o u l d t u r n t o suppression o f media as such, instead
o f seeking " c o n t e n t " c o n t r o l . T h e i r current assumption that c o n tent or p r o g r a m m i n g is the factor that influences o u t l o o k and
action is derived f r o m the b o o k m e d i u m , w i t h its sharp cleavage
between f o r m and content.
Is i t n o t strange that T V should have been as revolutionary a
m e d i u m i n A m e r i c a i n the 1950s as radio i n Europe i n the 1930s?
Radio, the m e d i u m that resuscitated the tribal and kinship webs o f
the European m i n d i n the 1920s and 1930s, had no such effect i n
England or A m e r i c a . T h e r e , the erosion o f tribal bonds b y means
o f literacy and its industrial extensions had gone so far that our
radio d i d n o t achieve any notable t r i b a l reactions. Y e t t e n years
of T V have Europeanized even the U n i t e d States, as witness its

Television/315
changed feelings f o r space and personal relations. T h e r e is n e w
sensitivity t o the dance, plastic arts, and architecture, as w e l l as
the demand f o r the small car, the paperback, sculptural hairdos
and molded dress effects—to say n o t h i n g o f a new concern f o r
complex effects i n cuisine and i n the use o f wines. N o t w i t h s t a n d ing, i t w o u l d be misleading t o say that T V w i l l retribalize England
and America. T h e action o f radio on the w o r l d of resonant speech
and m e m o r y was hysterical. B u t T V has certainly made England
and America vulnerable t o radio where previously they had i m m u n i t y t o a great degree. For good or i l l , the T V image has
exerted a u n i f y i n g synesthetic force o n the sense-life o f these
intensely literate populations, such as they have lacked f o r centuries. I t is wise t o w i t h h o l d all value judgments w h e n s t u d y i n g
these media matters, since their effects are n o t capable o f being
isolated.
Synesthesia, or unified sense and imaginative life, had l o n g
seemed an unattainable dream t o W e s t e r n poets, painters, and
artists i n general. T h e y had looked w i t h s o r r o w and dismay on
the fragmented and impoverished imaginative life of Western l i t erate man i n the eighteenth century and later. Such was the message o f Blake and Pater, Yeats and D . H . Lawrence, and a host o f
other great figures. T h e y were n o t prepared t o have their dreams
realized i n everyday life b y the esthetic action o f radio and television. Yet these massive extensions of our central nervous systems
have enveloped W e s t e r n man i n a daily session of synesthesia.
T h e W e s t e r n w a y of life attained centuries since b y the rigorous
separation and specialization o f the senses, w i t h the visual sense
atop the hierarchy, is n o t able t o withstand the radio and T V
waves that wash about the great visual structure o f abstract I n dividual M a n . Those w h o , f r o m political motives, w o u l d n o w add
their force to the anti-individual action o f our electric technology
are p u n y subliminal automatons aping the patterns of the prevailing electric pressures. A century ago they w o u l d , w i t h equal
somnambulism, have faced i n the opposite direction. German
Romantic poets and philosophers had been chanting i n t r i b a l
chorus f o r a r e t u r n t o the dark unconscious f o r over a century

before radio and H i t l e r made such a r e t u r n difficult t o avoid.
W h a t is t o be t h o u g h t o f people w h o w i s h such a r e t u r n t o preliterate ways, w h e n t h e y have no i n k l i n g of h o w the civilized
visual w a y was ever substituted f o r t r i b a l a u d i t o r y magic?
A t this hour, w h e n Americans are discovering n e w passions
f o r skin-diving and the wraparound space o f small cars, thanks t o
the indomitable tactile promptings o f the T V image, the same
image is inspiring m a n y English people w i t h race feelings o f tribal
exclusiveness. Whereas h i g h l y literate Westerners have always
idealized the c o n d i t i o n of integration of races, i t has been their
literate culture that made impossible real u n i f o r m i t y among races.
Literate man naturally dreams o f visual solutions t o the problems
of human differences. A t the end o f the nineteenth century, this
k i n d o f dream suggested similar dress and education f o r b o t h men
and w o m e n . T h e failure of the sex-integration programs has p r o vided the theme o f m u c h of the literature and psychoanalysis of
the t w e n t i e t h century. Race integration, undertaken o n the basis
of visual u n i f o r m i t y , is an extension o f the same cultural strategy
of literate man, f o r w h o m differences always seem to need eradicat i o n , b o t h i n sex and i n race, and i n space and i n time. Electronic
man, b y becoming ever more deeply involved i n the actualities of
the human condition, cannot accept the literate c u l t u r a l strategy.
T h e N e g r o w i l l reject a plan o f visual u n i f o r m i t y as definitely as
w o m e n d i d earlier, and f o r the same reasons. W o m e n f o u n d that
they had been robbed of their distinctive roles and t u r n e d i n t o
fragmented citizens i n "a man's w o r l d . " T h e entire approach t o
these problems i n terms o f u n i f o r m i t y and social homogenization
is a final pressure of the mechanical and industrial technology.
W i t h o u t moralizing, i t can be said that the electric age, b y i n v o l v i n g all men deeply i n one another, w i l l come t o reject such
mechanical solutions. I t is more difficult to provide uniqueness
and diversity than i t is t o impose the u n i f o r m patterns o f mass
education; b u t i t is such uniqueness and diversity that can be
fostered under electric conditions as never before.
T e m p o r a r i l y , all preliterate groups i n the w o r l d have begun
to feel the explosive and aggressive energies that are released b y the
onset o f the n e w literacy and mechanization. These explosions

Television/317
come just at a time w h e n the new electric technology combines
t o make us share them o n a global scale.
T h e effect of T V , as the most recent and spectacular electric
extension of our central nervous system, is hard to grasp f o r v a r i ous reasons. Since i t has affected the t o t a l i t y o f our lives, personal
and social and political, i t w o u l d be quite unrealistic t o attempt
a "systematic" or visual presentation o f such influence. Instead,
i t is more feasible to "present" T V as a complex gestalt o f data
gathered almost at r a n d o m .
T h e T V image is of l o w intensity or definition, and, therefore,
unlike film, i t does n o t afford detailed i n f o r m a t i o n about objects.
T h e difference is akin t o that between the o l d manuscripts and the
p r i n t e d w o r d . P r i n t gave intensity and u n i f o r m precision, where
before there had been a diffuse texture. P r i n t b r o u g h t i n the taste
f o r exact measurement and repeatability that w e n o w associate
w i t h science and mathematics.
T h e T V producer w i l l point out that speech o n television
must n o t have the careful precision necessary i n the theater. T h e
T V actor does n o t have t o project either his voice or himself.
Likewise, T V acting is so extremely intimate, because o f the
peculiar involvement of the viewer w i t h the completion or "closi n g " o f the T V image, that the actor must achieve a great degree
o f spontaneous casualness that w o u l d be irrelevant i n movie and
lost o n stage. For the audience participates i n the inner life of the
T V actor as f u l l y as i n the outer life of the movie star. T e c h n i c a l l y ,
T V tends t o be a close-up medium. T h e close-up that i n the movie
is used f o r shock is, o n T V , a quite casual t h i n g . A n d whereas a
glossy photo the size of the T V screen w o u l d show a dozen faces
i n adequate detail, a dozen faces on the T V screen are o n l y a b l u r .
T h e peculiar character o f the T V image i n its relation to
the actor causes such familiar reactions as our n o t being able t o
recognize i n real life a person w h o m w e see every week o n T V .
N o t m a n y of us are as alert as the kindergartener w h o said t o
G a r r y M o o r e , " H o w d i d y o u get off T V ? " Newscasters and actors
alike report the frequency w i t h w h i c h t h e y are approached b y
people w h o feel they've met them before. Joanne W o o d w a r d i n
an i n t e r v i e w was asked w h a t was the difference between being

a movie star and a T V actress. She replied: " W h e n I was i n the
movies I heard people say, 'There goes Joanne W o o d w a r d . ' N o w
they say, 'There goes somebody I t h i n k I k n o w . ' "
T h e owner o f a H o l l y w o o d hotel i n an area where many
movie and T V actors reside reported that tourists had switched
their allegiance t o T V stars. Moreover, most T V stars are men,
that is, " c o o l characters," w h i l e most movie stars are w o m e n , since
they can be presented as " h o t " characters. M e n and w o m e n movie
stars alike, along w i t h the entire star system, have tended t o
dwindle i n t o a more moderate status since T V . T h e movie is a
hot, high-definition medium. Perhaps the most interesting observat i o n of the hotel proprietor was that the tourists w a n t e d t o see
Perry Mason and W y a t t Earp. T h e y d i d n o t w a n t t o see R a y m o n d
B u r r and H u g h O'Brian. T h e o l d movie-fan tourists had wanted
to see their favorites as they were i n real life, n o t as t h e y were i n
their film roles. T h e fans of the cool T V m e d i u m w a n t t o see their
star i n role, whereas the movie fans w a n t the real thing.
A similar reversal o f attitudes occurred w i t h the p r i n t e d book.
T h e r e was little interest i n the private lives o f authors under manuscript or scribal culture. T o d a y the comic strip is close t o the prep r i n t w o o d c u t and manuscript f o r m o f expression. W a l t Kelly's
Pogo looks v e r y m u c h indeed like a gothic page. Y e t i n spite o f
great public interest i n the comic-strip f o r m , there is as little c u r i osity about the private lives o f these artists as about the lives of
popular-song w r i t e r s . W i t h p r i n t , the private life became of the
utmost concern to readers. P r i n t is a h o t medium. I t projects the
author at the public as the movie d i d . T h e manuscript is a cool
medium that does n o t project the author, so m u c h as involve the
reader. So w i t h T V . T h e viewer is involved and participant. T h e
role o f the T V star, i n this w a y , seems more fascinating than his
private life. I t is thus that the student o f media, like the psychiatrist, gets more data f r o m his informants than t h e y themselves
have perceived. E v e r y b o d y experiences far more than he understands. Yet i t is experience, rather than understanding, that influx
ences behavior, especially i n collective matters of media and technology, where the individual is almost inevitably unaware of their
effect upon h i m .

Television/'319
Some may find i t paradoxical that a cool medium like T V
should be so m u c h more compressed and condensed than a h o t
medium like film. B u t i t is w e l l k n o w n that a half minute o f television is equal to three minutes of stage or vaudeville. T h e same is
true of manuscript i n contrast to p r i n t . T h e " c o o l " manuscript
tended t o w a r d compressed forms o f statement, aphoristic and
allegorical. T h e " h o t " p r i n t medium expanded expression i n the
direction o f simplification and the "spelling-out" o f meanings.
P r i n t speeded up and "exploded" the compressed script i n t o simpler fragments.
A cool medium, whether the spoken w o r d or the manuscript
or T V , leaves m u c h more f o r the listener or user t o do than a
h o t medium. I f the m e d i u m is o f h i g h definition, participation is
l o w . I f the medium is o f l o w intensity, the participation is h i g h .
Perhaps this is w h y lovers mumble so.
Because the l o w definition o f T V insures a h i g h degree o f
audience involvement, the most effective programs are those that
present situations w h i c h consist o f some process t o be completed.
T h u s , t o use T V t o teach poetry w o u l d permit the teacher t o
concentrate on the poetic process o f actual making, as i t pertained t o a particular poem. T h e book f o r m is quite unsuited
to this t y p e of involved presentation. T h e same salience of p r o c ess of do-it-yourself-ness and depth involvement i n the T V image
extends t o the art o f the T V actor. U n d e r T V conditions, he
must be alert t o improvise and t o embellish every phrase and
verbal resonance w i t h details of gesture and posture, sustaining
that intimacy w i t h the viewer w h i c h is n o t possible o n the massive
movie screen or o n the stage.
T h e r e is the alleged remark of the N i g e r i a n w h o , after seei n g a T V western, said delightedly, " I d i d n o t realize y o u valued
human life so little i n the W e s t . " Offsetting this remark is the behavior o f our children i n w a t c h i n g T V westerns. W h e n equipped
w i t h the new experimental head-cameras that f o l l o w their eye
movements w h i l e w a t c h i n g the image, children keep their eyes
on the faces of the T V actors. Even d u r i n g physical violence their
eyes remain concentrated o n the facial reactions, rather than o n
the eruptive action. Guns, knives, fists, all are ignored i n prefer-

320/'Understanding

ence f o r the facial expression. T V is n o t so m u c h an action, as a
re-action, medium.
T h e y e n o f the T V medium f o r themes of process and c o m plex reactions has enabled the documentary type of f i l m t o come
t o the fore. T h e movie can handle process superbly, b u t the movie
viewer is more disposed t o be a passive consumer of actions,
rather than a participant i n reactions. T h e movie western, like
the movie documentary, has always been a l o w l y f o r m . W i t h T V ,
the western acquired new importance, since its theme is always:
"Let's make a t o w n . " T h e audience participates i n the shaping
and processing o f a c o m m u n i t y f r o m meager and unpromising
components. Moreover, the T V image takes k i n d l y t o the varied
and r o u g h textures o f Western saddles, clothes, hides, and shoddy
m a t c h - w o o d bars and hotel lobbies. T h e movie camera, b y contrast, is at home i n the slick chrome w o r l d of the n i g h t club and
the l u x u r y spots o f a metropolis. Moreover, the contrasting camera preferences o f the movies i n the Twenties and T h i r t i e s , and
o f T V i n the Fifties and Sixties spread t o the entire population.
I n ten years the new tastes o f America i n clothes, i n f o o d , i n housing, i n entertainment, and i n vehicles express the n e w pattern o f
interrelation of forms and do-it-yourself involvement fostered b y
the T V image.
I t is no accident that such major movie stars as Rita H a y w o r t h , L i z T a y l o r , and M a r i l y n M o n r o e ran i n t o t r o u b l e d waters
i n the new T V age. T h e y ran i n t o an age that questioned all the
" h o t " media values of the p r e - T V consumer days. T h e T V image
challenges the values of fame as m u c h as the values o f consumer
goods. "Fame to me," said M a r i l y n M o n r o e , "certainly is o n l y a
temporary and a partial happiness. Fame is n o t really f o r a daily
diet, that's n o t w h a t fulfills y o u . . . . I t h i n k that w h e n y o u are
famous every weakness is exaggerated. T h i s i n d u s t r y should behave t o its stars like a mother whose child has just r u n out i n
f r o n t o f a car. B u t instead o f clasping the child t o t h e m t h e y start
punishing the c h i l d . "
T h e movie c o m m u n i t y is n o w getting clobbered b y T V , and
lashes out at a n y b o d y i n its bewildered petulance. These words
of the great movie puppet w h o w e d M r . Baseball and M r . Broad-

Television/321
w a y are surely a portent. I f many of the r i c h and successful figures
in America were to question p u b l i c l y the absolute value o f money
and success as means t o happiness and human welfare, they w o u l d
offer no more shattering a precedent than M a r i l y n M o n r o e . F o r
nearly fifty years, H o l l y w o o d had offered "the fallen w o m a n "
a w a y to the t o p and a w a y t o the hearts o f all. Suddenly the
love-goddess emits a horrible c r y , screams that eating people is
w r o n g , and utters denunciations of the w h o l e w a y o f life. T h i s is
exactly the m o o d o f the suburban beatniks. T h e y reject a f r a g mented and specialist consumer life f o r a n y t h i n g that offers
humble involvement and deep commitment. I t is the same m o o d
that recently turned girls f r o m specialist careers to early marriage
and b i g families. T h e y s w i t c h f r o m jobs t o roles.
T h e same new preference f o r depth participation has also
p r o m p t e d i n the y o u n g a strong drive t o w a r d religious experience
w i t h r i c h liturgical overtones. T h e liturgical revival of the radio
and T V age affects even the most austere Protestant sects. Choral
chant and r i c h vestments have appeared i n every quarter. T h e
ecumenical movement is synonymous w i t h electric technology.
Just as T V , the mosaic mesh, does n o t foster perspective i n
art, i t does n o t foster lineality i n living. Since T V , the assembly
line has disappeared f r o m industry. Staff and line structures have
dissolved i n management. Gone are the stag line, the p a r t y line,
the receiving line, and the pencil line f r o m the backs of nylons.
W i t h T V came the end o f bloc v o t i n g i n politics, a f o r m o f
specialism and fragmentation that w o n ' t w o r k since T V . Instead
o f the v o t i n g bloc, w e have the icon, the inclusive image. Instead
o f a political v i e w p o i n t or p l a t f o r m , the inclusive political posture
or stance. Instead o f the p r o d u c t , the process. I n periods o f new and
rapid g r o w t h there is a b l u r r i n g of outlines. I n the T V image w e
have the supremacy o f the blurred outline, itself the maximal
incentive to g r o w t h and new "closure" or completion, especially
f o r a consumer culture l o n g related to the sharp visual values that
had become separated f r o m the other senses. So great is the change
i n A m e r i c a n lives, resulting f r o m the loss o f l o y a l t y to the c o n sumer package i n entertainment and commerce, that every enterprise, f r o m Madison Avenue and General M o t o r s t o H o l l y w o o d

322/Understanding

Media

and General Foods, has been shaken t h o r o u g h l y and forced t o
seek n e w strategies o f action. W h a t electric implosion or contraction has done inter-personally and inter-nationally, the T V
image does intra-personally or intra-sensuously.
I t is n o t hard t o explain this sensuous r e v o l u t i o n t o painters
and sculptors, f o r t h e y have been striving, ever since Cézanne
abandoned perspective illusion i n favor of structure i n painting,
t o b r i n g about the v e r y change that T V has n o w effected o n a
fantastic scale. T V is the Bauhaus p r o g r a m of design and l i v i n g ,
or the Montessori educational strategy, given total technological
extension and commercial sponsorship. T h e aggressive lunge o f
artistic strategy f o r the remaking o f W e s t e r n man has, via T V ,
become a vulgar sprawl and an o v e r w h e l m i n g splurge i n A m e r i c a n
life.
I t w o u l d be impossible t o exaggerate the degree t o w h i c h
this image has disposed America t o European modes o f sense and
sensibility. A m e r i c a is n o w Europeanizing as f u r i o u s l y as Europe
is Americanizing. Europe, d u r i n g the Second W a r , developed
m u c h of the industrial technology needed f o r its first mass consumer phase. I t was, on the other hand, the First W a r that had
readied America f o r the same consumer "take-off." I t t o o k the
electronic implosion t o dissolve the nationalist diversity o f a
splintered Europe, and t o do f o r i t w h a t the industrial explosion
had done f o r America. T h e industrial explosion that accompanies
the fragmenting expansion of literacy and i n d u s t r y was able t o
exert little u n i f y i n g effect i n the European w o r l d w i t h its numerous tongues and cultures. T h e Napoleonic thrust had utilized the
combined force o f the new literacy and early industrialism. B u t
Napoleon had had a less homogenized set of materials t o w o r k
w i t h than even the Russians have today. T h e homogenizing p o w e r
of the literate process had gone f u r t h e r i n America b y 1800 than
anywhere i n Europe. F r o m the first, America t o o k t o heart the
p r i n t technology f o r its educational, industrial, and political l i f e ;
and i t was rewarded b y an unprecedented p o o l o f standardized
workers and consumers, such as no culture had ever had before.
T h a t our c u l t u r a l historians have been oblivious o f the homogenizing p o w e r o f t y p o g r a p h y , and o f the irresistible strength o f

Television/323
homogenized populations, is no credit t o them. Political scientists
have been quite unaware o f the effects o f media anywhere at any
time, simply because n o b o d y has been w i l l i n g t o study the personal and social effects o f media apart f r o m their "content."
America l o n g ago achieved its C o m m o n M a r k e t b y mechanical
and literate homogenization o f social organization. Europe is n o w
getting a u n i t y under the electric auspices of compression and i n terrelation. Just h o w m u c h homogenization via literacy is needed
to make an effective producer-consumer g r o u p i n the postmechanical age, i n the age o f automation, n o b o d y has ever asked.
F o r i t has never been f u l l y recognized that the role of literacy i n
shaping an industrial economy is basic and archetypal. L i t e r a c y
is indispensable f o r habits o f u n i f o r m i t y at all times and places.
A b o v e all, i t is needed f o r the w o r k a b i l i t y o f price systems and
markets. T h i s factor has been ignored exactly as T V is n o w being
ignored, f o r T V fosters m a n y preferences that are quite at v a r i ance w i t h literate u n i f o r m i t y and repeatability. I t has sent A m e r icans questing f o r every sort o f oddment and quaintness i n objects
f r o m o u t o f their storied past. M a n y Americans w i l l n o w spare
no pains or expense t o get t o taste some n e w w i n e or f o o d . T h e
u n i f o r m and repeatable n o w must y i e l d t o the uniquely askew, a
fact that is increasingly the despair and confusion of our entire
standardized economy.
T h e power o f the T V mosaic t o transform A m e r i c a n i n n o cence i n t o depth sophistication, independently of "content," is n o t
mysterious i f looked at d i r e c t l y . T h i s mosaic T V image had already been adumbrated i n the popular press that g r e w u p w i t h
the telegraph. T h e commercial use o f the telegraph began i n 1844
i n America, and earlier i n England. T h e electric principle and its
implications received m u c h attention i n Shelley's p o e t r y . A r t i s t i c
r u l e - o f - t h u m b usually anticipates the science and technology i n
these matters b y a f u l l generation or more. T h e meaning of the
telegraph mosaic i n its journalistic
manifestations was not lost t o
the m i n d o f Edgar A l l a n Poe. H e used i t t o establish t w o startl i n g l y new inventions, the symbolist poem and the detective story.
B o t h o f these forms require do-it-yourself participation on the
part o f the reader. B y o f f e r i n g an incomplete image or process, Poe

324/Understanding

involved his readers i n the creative process i n a w a y that Baudelaire, Valéry, T . S. E l i o t , and m a n y others have admired and f o l l o w e d . Poe had grasped at once the electric dynamic as one o f
public participation i n creativity. Nevertheless, even today the
homogenized consumer complains w h e n asked t o participate i n
creating or completing an abstract poem or painting or structure
o f any k i n d . Y e t Poe k n e w even then that participation i n depth
f o l l o w e d at once f r o m the telegraph mosaic. T h e more lineal and
literal-minded o f the literary brahmins "just couldn't see i t . " T h e y
still can't see i t . T h e y prefer n o t t o participate i n the creative
process. T h e y have accommodated themselves t o the completed
packages, i n prose and verse and i n the plastic arts. I t is these people w h o must c o n f r o n t , i n every classroom i n the land, students
w h o have accommodated themselves t o the tactile and nonpictorial
modes o f symbolist and m y t h i c structures, thanks t o the T V
image.
Life magazine f o r A u g u s t 10, 1962, had a feature o n h o w
" T o o M a n y Subteens G r o w U p T o o Soon and T o o Fast." T h e r e
was no observation of the fact that similar speed o f g r o w t h and
precociousness have always been the n o r m i n tribal cultures and
i n nonliterate societies. England and A m e r i c a fostered the institut i o n of prolonged adolescence b y the negation of the tactile participation that is sex. I n this, there was no conscious strategy, b u t
rather a general acceptance of the consequences o f p r i m e stress
o n the printed w o r d and visual values as a means o f organizing
personal and social life. T h i s stress led t o triumphs o f industrial
p r o d u c t i o n and political c o n f o r m i t y that were their o w n sufficient
warrant.
Respectability, or the ability t o sustain visual inspection o f one's
life, became dominant. N o European c o u n t r y allowed p r i n t such
precedence. Visually, Europe has always been shoddy i n A m e r i c a n
eyes. A m e r i c a n w o m e n , o n the other hand, w h o have never been
equaled i n any culture f o r visual t u r n o u t , have always seemed abstract, mechanical dolls to Europeans. T a c t i l i t y is a supreme value
i n European life. For that reason, o n the Continent there is no
adolescence, b u t o n l y the leap f r o m c h i l d h o o d to adult ways. Such
is n o w the A m e r i c a n state since T V , and this state o f evasion o f

Television/32

adolescence w i l l continue. T h e introspective life o f long, l o n g
thoughts and distant goals, t o be pursued i n lines of Siberian r a i l road k i n d , cannot coexist w i t h the mosaic f o r m o f the T V image
that commands immediate participation i n depth and admits o f
no delays. T h e mandates o f that image are so various y e t so consistent that even t o mention them is to describe the r e v o l u t i o n o f
the past decade.
T h e phenomenon o f the paperback, the b o o k i n " c o o l " version, can head this list o f T V mandates, because the T V transf o r m a t i o n o f book culture i n t o something else is manifested at that
point. Europeans have had paperbacks f r o m the first. F r o m the
beginnings o f the automobile, they have preferred the w r a p a r o u n d
space of the small car. T h e pictorial value o f "enclosed space" f o r
book, car, or house has never appealed t o them. T h e paperback,
especially i n its h i g h b r o w f o r m , was t r i e d i n America i n the 1920s
and thirties and forties. I t was not, however, u n t i l 1953 that i t
suddenly became acceptable. N o publisher really knows w h y .
N o t o n l y is the paperback a tactile, rather than a visual, package;
i t can be as readily concerned w i t h p r o f o u n d matters as w i t h
f r o t h . T h e American since T V has lost his inhibitions and his
innocence about depth culture. T h e paperback reader has discovered that he can enjoy Aristotle or Confucius b y simply
slowing d o w n . T h e o l d literate habit o f racing ahead o n u n i f o r m
lines o f p r i n t yielded suddenly t o depth reading. Reading i n depth
is, o f course, not proper t o the printed w o r d as such. D e p t h p r o b i n g o f w o r d s and language is a normal feature o f oral and manuscript cultures, rather than o f p r i n t . Europeans have always felt
that the English and Americans lacked depth i n their culture.
Since radio, and especially since T V , English and A m e r i c a n
l i t e r a r y critics have exceeded the performance o f any European
i n depth and subtlety. T h e beatnik reaching o u t f o r Zen is o n l y
c a r r y i n g the mandate o f the T V mosaic o u t i n t o the w o r l d of
w o r d s and perception. T h e paperback itself has become a vast
mosaic w o r l d i n depth, expressive of the changed sense-life of
Americans, f o r w h o m depth experience i n w o r d s , as i n physics,
has become entirely acceptable, and even sought after.

ican attitudes since T V is a most a r b i t r a r y affair, as can be seen
i n a change so great as the abrupt decline of baseball. T h e removal
of the B r o o k l y n Dodgers t o Los Angeles was a portent i n itself.
Baseball moved W e s t i n an attempt t o retain an audience after
T V struck. T h e characteristic mode o f the baseball game is that
i t features one-thing-at-a-time. I t is a lineal, expansive game w h i c h ,
like golf, is perfectly adapted t o the outlook of an individualist
and inner-directed society. T i m i n g and w a i t i n g are o f the essence,
w i t h the entire field i n suspense w a i t i n g u p o n the performance
of a single player. B y contrast, football, basketball, and ice hockey
are games i n w h i c h many events occur simultaneously, w i t h the
entire team involved at the same time. W i t h the advent o f T V ,
such isolation o f the individual performance as occurs i n baseball
became unacceptable. Interest i n baseball declined, and its stars,
quite as m u c h as movie stars, f o u n d that fame had some v e r y
cramping dimensions. Baseball had been, like the movies, a h o t
medium featuring individual v i r t u o s i t y and stellar performers.
T h e real ball fan is a store of statistical i n f o r m a t i o n about previous
explosions o f batters and pitchers i n numerous games. N o t h i n g
could indicate more clearly the peculiar satisfaction p r o v i d e d b y
a game that belonged t o the industrial metropolis o f ceaselessly exploding populations, stocks and bonds, and p r o d u c t i o n and sales
records. Baseball belonged to the age o f the first onset o f the h o t
press and the movie medium. I t w i l l always remain a s y m b o l of the
era o f the h o t mommas, jazz babies, o f sheiks and shebas, o f vamps
and gold-diggers and the fast buck. Baseball, i n a w o r d , is a h o t
game that got cooled off i n the n e w T V climate, as d i d most of the
h o t politicians and hot issues o f the earlier decades.
T h e r e is no cooler medium or hotter issue at present than the
small car. I t is like a badly w i r e d w o o f e r i n a h i - f i c i r c u i t that
produces a tremendous flutter i n the b o t t o m . T h e small European
car, like the European paperback and the European belle, f o r that
matter, was no visual package job. V i s u a l l y , the entire batch o f
European cars are so poor an affair that i t is obvious their makers
never thought of them as something t o l o o k at. T h e y are somet h i n g t o p u t on, like pants or a pullover. Theirs is the k i n d o f
space sought b y the skin-diver, the water-skier, and the d i n g h y

Television/'327
sailor. I n an immediate tactile sense, this n e w space is akin t o
that t o w h i c h the p i c t u r e - w i n d o w fad had catered. I n terms of
" v i e w , " the picture w i n d o w never made any sense. I n terms of an
attempt to discover a n e w dimension i n the out-of-doors b y pretending t o be a goldfish, the picture w i n d o w does make sense. So
do the frantic efforts t o roughen up the i n d o o r walls and textures
as i f they were the outside of the house. Exactly the same impulse
sends the indoor spaces and f u r n i t u r e out i n t o the patios i n an
attempt t o experience the outside as inside. T h e T V viewer is
i n just that role at all times. H e is submarine. H e is bombarded
b y atoms that reveal the outside as inside i n an endless adventure
amidst b l u r r e d images and mysterious contours.
H o w e v e r , the A m e r i c a n car had been fashioned i n accordance
w i t h the visual mandates of the typographic and the movie images.
T h e A m e r i c a n car was an enclosed space, n o t a tactile space. A n d
an enclosed space, as was shown i n the chapter on P r i n t , is one
i n w h i c h all spatial qualities have been reduced t o visual terms.
So i n the American car, as the French observed decades ago, "one
is n o t o n the road, one is i n the car." B y contrast, the European
car aims t o drag y o u along the road and t o provide a great deal
o f v i b r a t i o n f o r the b o t t o m . Brigitte Bardot got into the news
w h e n i t was discovered that she liked t o drive barefoot i n order
to get the maximal v i b r a t i o n . Even English cars, weak o n visual
appearance as they are, have been g u i l t y o f advertising that "at
sixty miles an hour all y o u can hear is the t i c k i n g of the clock."
T h a t w o u l d be a v e r y p o o r ad, indeed, f o r a T V generation that
has t o be with everything and has t o dig things i n order t o get
at them. So avid is the T V viewer f o r r i c h tactile effects that
he c o u l d be counted o n t o revert t o skis. T h e wheel, so far as he
is concerned, lacks the requisite abrasiveness.
Clothes i n this first T V decade repeat the same story as
vehicles. T h e r e v o l u t i o n was heralded b y bobby-soxers w h o
dumped the w h o l e cargo o f visual effects f o r a set o f tactile ones so
extreme as t o create a dead level of flat-footed dead-panism. Part
o f the cool dimension o f T V is the cool, deadpan m u g that came
i n w i t h the teenager. Adolescence, i n the age o f h o t media, o f radio
and movie, and of the ancient book, had been a time o f fresh, eager,

328/Understanding

and expressive countenances. N o elder statesman or senior executive of the 1940s w o u l d have ventured t o wear so dead and
sculptural a pan as the c h i l d o f the T V age. T h e dances that
came i n w i t h T V were t o match—all the w a y t o the T w i s t , w h i c h
is merely a f o r m o f v e r y unanimated dialogue, the gestures and
grimaces o f w h i c h indicate involvement i n depth, b u t " n o t h i n g
t o say."
C l o t h i n g and s t y l i n g i n the past decade have gone so tactile
and sculptural that they present a sort o f exaggerated evidence o f
the new qualities o f the T V mosaic. T h e T V extension o f our nerves
i n hirsute pattern possesses the p o w e r t o evoke a f l o o d o f related
imagery i n clothing, hairdo, w a l k , and gesture.
A l l this adds u p t o the compressional implosion—the r e t u r n
t o nonspecialized forms of clothes and spaces, the seeking of
multi-uses f o r rooms and things and objects, i n a single word—the
iconic. I n music and poetry and painting, the tactile implosion
means the insistence on qualities that are close t o casual speech.
T h u s Schonberg and Stravinsky and Carl O r f f and Bartok, far
f r o m being advanced seekers o f esoteric effects, seem n o w t o have
b r o u g h t music v e r y close t o the c o n d i t i o n o f o r d i n a r y human
speech. I t is this colloquial r h y t h m that once seemed so unmelodious about their w o r k . A n y o n e w h o listens t o the medieval w o r k s
o f Perotinus or D u f a y w i l l f i n d t h e m v e r y close t o Stravinsky and
Bartok. T h e great explosion o f the Renaissance that split musical
instruments off f r o m song and speech and gave t h e m specialist
functions is n o w being played b a c k w a r d i n our age o f electronic
implosion.
One o f the most v i v i d examples o f the tactile quality of the
T V image occurs i n medical experience. I n closed-circuit instruct i o n i n surgery, medical students f r o m the first reported a strange
effect—that they seemed not t o be w a t c h i n g an operation, b u t
p e r f o r m i n g i t . T h e y felt that they were h o l d i n g the scalpel. T h u s
the T V image, i n fostering a passion f o r depth involvement i n
every aspect of experience, creates an obsession w i t h b o d i l y w e l fare. T h e sudden emergence of the T V medico and the hospital
w a r d as a program t o rival the western is perfectly natural. I t
w o u l d be possible to list a dozen u n t r i e d kinds of programs that

Television/329
w o u l d prove immediately popular f o r the same reasons. T o m
D o o l e y and his epic o f Medicare f o r the backward society was a
natural o u t g r o w t h o f the first T V decade.
N o w that w e have considered the subliminal force o f the T V
image i n a redundant scattering of samples, the question w o u l d
seem t o arise: " W h a t possible immunhy can there be f r o m the
subliminal operation o f a n e w medium like television?" People
have l o n g supposed that b u l l d o g opacity, backed b y firm disapproval, is adequate enough protection against any n e w experience.
I t is the theme o f this b o o k that not even the most l u c i d understanding o f the peculiar force o f a medium can head off the o r d i nary "closure" o f the senses that causes us t o c o n f o r m t o the pattern
o f experience presented. T h e utmost p u r i t y o f m i n d is no defense against bacteria, t h o u g h the confreres of Louis Pasteur
tossed h i m out of the medical profession f o r his base allegations
about the invisible operation o f bacteria. T o resist T V , therefore, one must acquire the antidote of related media like p r i n t .
I t is an especially t o u c h y area that presents itself w i t h the
question: " W h a t has been the effect of T V o n our political l i f e ? "
Here, at least, great traditions o f critical awareness and vigilance
testify t o the safeguards w e have posted against the dastardly uses
of power.
W h e n Theodore W h i t e ' s The Making of the President:
1960
is opened at the section o n " T h e Television Debates," the T V
student w i l l experience dismay. W h i t e offers statistics on the n u m ber o f sets i n A m e r i c a n homes and the number of hours o f daily
use o f these sets, b u t n o t one clue as t o the nature of the T V
image or its effects o n candidates or viewers. W h i t e considers
the " c o n t e n t " of the debates and the deportment of the debaters,
b u t i t never occurs t o h i m t o ask w h y T V w o u l d inevitably be a
disaster f o r a sharp intense image like N i x o n ' s , and a boon f o r
the b l u r r y , shaggy texture o f Kennedy.
A t the end o f the debates, Philip Deane o f the L o n d o n Observer explained m y idea o f the coming T V impact o n the elect i o n t o the Toronto Globe and Mail under the headline o f " T h e
Sheriff and the L a w y e r , " October 15, 1960. I t was that T V w o u l d

tdon. W i t h o u t T V , N i x o n had i t made. Deane, t o w a r d the end of
his article, w r o t e :
N o w the press has tended to say that M r . N i x o n has been
gaining i n the last t w o debates and that he was bad i n the first.
Professor McLuhan thinks that M r . N i x o n has been sounding
progressively more definite; regardless of the value of the
Vice-President's views and principles, he has been defending
them w i t h too much flourish for the T V medium. M r . Kennedy's rather sharp responses have been a mistake, but he still
presents an image closer to the T V hero, Professor McLuhan
says—something like the shy young Sheriff—while M r . N i x o n
w i t h his very dark eyes that tend to stare, w i t h his slicker
circumlocution, has resembled more the railway lawyer who
signs leases that are not i n the interests of the folks i n the
little town.
I n fact, by counterattacking and by claiming f o r himself,
as he does i n the T V debates, the same goals as the Democrats have, M r . N i x o n may be helping his opponent by blurring the Kennedy image, by confusing what exactly i t is that
M r . Kennedy wants to change.
M r . Kennedy is thus not handicapped by clear-cut issues;
he is visually a less well-defined image, and appears more nonchalant. H e seems less anxious to sell himself than does M r .
Nixon. So far, then, Professor McLuhan gives M r . Kennedy
the lead without underestimating M r . Nixon's formidable
appeal to the vast conservative forces of the United States.
A n o t h e r w a y o f explaining the acceptable, as opposed to the
unacceptable, T V personality is t o say that anybody whose appearance strongly declares his role and status i n life is w r o n g f o r T V .
A n y b o d y w h o looks as i f he m i g h t be a teacher, a doctor, a
businessman, or any o f a dozen other things all at the same time
is r i g h t f o r T V . W h e n the person presented looks classifiable, as
N i x o n d i d , the T V viewer has n o t h i n g t o fill i n . H e feels u n c o m fortable w i t h his T V image. H e says uneasily, "There's something
about the g u y that isn't r i g h t . " T h e viewer feels exactly the same
about an exceedingly p r e t t y g i r l o n T V , or about any o f the i n tense " h i g h d e f i n i t i o n " images and messages f r o m the sponsors. I t
is n o t accidental that advertising has become a vast n e w source o f
comic effects since the advent o f T V . M r . Khrushchev is a v e r y
filled-in or completed image that appears o n T V as a comic car-

Television/'331
t o o n . I n w i r e p h o t o and o n T V , M r . Khrushchev is a jovial comic,
an entirely disarming presence. Likewise, precisely the f o r m u l a
that recommends a n y b o d y f o r a movie role disqualifies that same
person f o r T V acceptance. For the hot movie m e d i u m needs people
w h o l o o k v e r y definitely a type o f some k i n d . T h e cool T V
m e d i u m cannot abide the t y p i c a l because i t leaves the viewer
frustrated o f his job o f 'closure" or completion o f image. President Kennedy d i d n o t l o o k like a r i c h man or like a politician. H e
could have been a n y t h i n g f r o m a grocer or a professor to a f o o t b a l l
coach. H e was not too precise o r too ready o f speech i n such a w a y
as t o spoil his pleasantly t w e e d y b l u r o f countenance and outline.
H e w e n t f r o m palace t o l o g cabin, f r o m wealth t o the W h i t e
House, i n a pattern o f T V reversal and upset.
T h e same components w i l l be f o u n d i n any popular T V
figure. E d Sullivan, "the great stone face," as he was k n o w n f r o m
the first, has the m u c h needed harshness o f texture and general
sculptural quality demanded f o r serious regard o n T V . Jack Paar
is quite otherwise—neither shaggy nor sculptural. B u t on the other
hand, his presence is entirely acceptable o n T V because o f his
u t t e r l y cool and casual verbal agility. T h e Jack Paar show revealed
the inherent need o f T V f o r spontaneous chat and dialogue. Jack
discovered h o w t o extend the T V mosaic image i n t o the entire
f o r m a t o f his show, seemingly snaffling u p just a n y b o d y f r o m anywhere at the drop o f a hat. I n fact, however, he understood v e r y
w e l l h o w t o create a mosaic f r o m other media, f r o m the w o r l d o f
journalism and politics, books, Broadway, and the arts i n general,
u n t i l he became a formidable rival to the press mosaic itself. A s
A m o s and A n d y had l o w e r e d church attendance o n Sunday evenings i n the o l d days o f radio, so Jack Parr certainly c u t n i g h t club patronage w i t h his late show.
H o w about Educational Television? W h e n the three-year-old
sits w a t c h i n g the President's press conference w i t h D a d and
Grandad, that illustrates the serious educational role o f T V .
I f w e ask w h a t is the relation o f T V t o the learning process, the
answer is surely that the T V image, b y its stress o n participation,
dialogue, and depth, has b r o u g h t t o A m e r i c a n e w demand f o r
crash-programming i n education. W h e t h e r there ever w i l l be T V

332/Understanding

i n every classroom is a small matter. T h e r e v o l u t i o n has already
taken place at home. T V has changed our sense-lives and our
mental processes. I t has created a taste f o r all experience in depth
that affects language teaching as m u c h as car styles. Since T V ,
n o b o d y is happy w i t h a mere b o o k knowledge o f French or
English poetry. T h e unanimous c r y n o w is, "Let's talk F r e n c h , "
and " L e t the bard be heard" A n d o d d l y enough, w i t h the demand
f o r depth, goes the demand f o r crash-programming. N o t o n l y
deeper, b u t f u r t h e r , into all knowledge has become the normal
popular demand since T V . Perhaps enough has been said about the
nature of the T V image t o explain w h y this should be. H o w could
i t possibly pervade our lives any m o r e than i t does? M e r e classr o o m use could n o t extend its influence. O f course, i n the classr o o m its role compels a reshuffling o f subjects, and approaches t o
subjects. M e r e l y t o p u t the present classroom o n T V w o u l d be
like p u t t i n g movies o n T V . T h e result w o u l d be a h y b r i d that is
neither. T h e r i g h t approach is t o ask, " W h a t can T V do that the
classroom cannot do f o r French, or f o r physics?" T h e answer is:
" T V can illustrate the interplay o f process and the g r o w t h o f
forms o f all kinds as n o t h i n g else can."
T h e other side o f the story concerns the fact that, i n the visually organized educational and social w o r l d , the T V c h i l d is an
underprivileged cripple. A n oblique indication o f this startling
reversal has been given b y W i l l i a m Golding's Lord of the Flies.
O n the one hand, i t is v e r y flattering f o r hordes o f docile children
to be t o l d that, once out of the sight o f their governesses, the seethi n g savage passions w i t h i n them w o u l d b o i l over and sweep away
pram and playpen, alike. O n the other hand, M r . Golding's l i t t l e
pastoral parable does have some meaning i n terms o f the psychic
changes i n the T V child. T h i s matter is so i m p o r t a n t f o r any
f u t u r e strategy o f culture or politics that i t demands a headline
prominence, and capsulated summary:

T h e plunge i n t o depth experience via the T V image can o n l y
be explained i n terms of the differences between visual and mosaic
space. A b i l i t y t o discriminate between these radically different

Television/333
forms is quite rare i n our Western w o r l d . I t has been pointed out
that, i n the c o u n t r y o f the b l i n d , the one-eyed man is n o t k i n g .
H e is taken t o be an hallucinated lunatic. I n a h i g h l y visual culture,
i t is as difficult t o communicate the nonvisual properties o f spatial
forms as t o explain visuality t o the b l i n d . I n the A B C of Relativity
Bertrand Russell began b y explaining that there is n o t h i n g difficult
about Einstein's ideas, b u t that they do call f o r total reorganization
o f our imaginative lives. I t is precisely this imaginative reorganizat i o n that has occurred via the T V image.
T h e ordinary i n a b i l i t y t o discriminate between the p h o t o graphic and the T V image is n o t merely a c r i p p l i n g factor i n the
learning process t o d a y ; i t is symptomatic o f an age-old failure i n
W e s t e r n culture. T h e literate man, accustomed t o an environment
i n w h i c h the visual sense is extended everywhere as a principle o f
organization, sometimes supposes that the mosaic w o r l d o f p r i m i tive art, or even the w o r l d o f Byzantine art, represents a mere d i f ference i n degree, a sort o f failure to b r i n g their visual portrayals
u p t o the level o f f u l l visual effectiveness. N o t h i n g could be f u r t h e r
f r o m the t r u t h . This, i n fact, is a misconception that has impaired
understanding between East and W e s t f o r many centuries. T o d a y
i t impairs relations between colored and w h i t e societies.
M o s t technology produces an amplification that is quite exp l i c i t i n its separation o f the senses. Radio is an extension o f the
aural, h i g h - f i d e l i t y photography of the visual. But T V is, above
all, an extension o f the sense o f touch, w h i c h involves maximal
interplay of all the senses. F o r Western man, however, the a l l embracing extension had occurred b y means o f phonetic w r i t i n g ,
w h i c h is a technology f o r extending the sense of sight. A l l n o n phonetic forms o f w r i t i n g are, b y contrast, artistic modes that
retain m u c h variety o f sensuous orchestration. Phonetic w r i t i n g ,
alone, has the power o f separating and fragmenting the senses and
o f sloughing off the semantic complexities. T h e T V image reverses
this literate process o f analytic fragmentation of sensory life.
T h e visual stress o n c o n t i n u i t y , u n i f o r m i t y , and connectedness, as i t derives f r o m literacy, confronts us w i t h the great technological means o f implementing c o n t i n u i t y and lineality b y
fragmented repetition. T h e ancient w o r l d f o u n d this means i n the

334/Understanding

Media

b r i c k , whether f o r w a l l or road. T h e repetitive, u n i f o r m b r i c k ,
indispensable agent o f road and w a l l , o f cities and empires, is an
extension, via letters, o f the visual sense. The brick wall is not a
mosaic form, and neither is the mosaic f o r m a visual structure.
T h e mosaic can be seen as dancing can, b u t is n o t
structured
visually; nor is i t an extension o f the visual power. F o r the mosaic
is n o t u n i f o r m , continuous, or repetitive. I t is discontinuous, skew,
and nonlineal, like the tactual T V image. T o the sense o f t o u c h ,
all things are sudden, counter, original, spare, strange. T h e "Pied
Beauty" o f G . M . H o p k i n s is a catalogue of the notes o f the sense
o f touch. T h e poem is a manifesto o f the nonvisual, and like
Cézanne or Seurat, or Rouault i t provides an indispensable approach t o understanding T V . T h e nonvisual mosaic structures o f
modern art, like those o f modern physics and electric-information
patterns, permit little detachment. T h e mosaic f o r m o f the T V
image demands participation and involvement i n depth of the
whole being, as does the sense o f t o u c h . Literacy, i n contrast, had,
b y extending the visual power t o the u n i f o r m organization of time
and space, psychically and socially, conferred the p o w e r o f detachment and noninvolvement.
T h e visual sense w h e n extended b y phonetic literacy fosters
the analytic habit o f perceiving the single facet i n the l i f e o f forms.
T h e visual p o w e r enables us t o isolate the single incident i n time
and space, as i n representational art. I n visual representation of a
person or an object, a single phase or moment or aspect is separated f r o m the m u l t i t u d e of k n o w n and felt phases, moments and
aspects o f the person or object. B y contrast, iconographie art
uses the eye as w e use our hand i n seeking t o create an inclusive
image, made u p o f many moments, phases, and aspects of the
person or t h i n g . T h u s the iconic mode is n o t visual representation,
nor the specialization of visual stress as defined b y v i e w i n g f r o m
a single position. T h e tactual mode o f perceiving is sudden b u t n o t
specialist. I t is total, synesthetic, i n v o l v i n g all the senses. Pervaded b y the mosaic T V image, the T V c h i l d encounters the
w o r l d i n a spirit antithetic t o literacy.
T h e T V image, that is t o say, even more than the i c o n , is an
extension o f the sense of touch. W h e r e i t encounters a literate

Television/33

culture, i t necessarily thickens the sense-mix, transforming f r a g mented and specialist extensions i n t o a seamless w e b of experience.
Such transformation is, o f course, a "disaster" f o r a literate, specialist culture. I t blurs m a n y cherished attitudes and procedures.
I t dims the efficacy o f the basic pedagogic techniques, and the
relevance o f the c u r r i c u l u m . I f f o r no other reason, i t w o u l d be
w e l l t o understand the dynamic life of these forms as they i n t r u d e
u p o n us and u p o n one another. T V makes f o r myopia.
T h e y o u n g people w h o have experienced a decade o f T V
have naturally imbibed an urge t o w a r d involvement i n depth
that makes all the remote visualized goals o f usual culture seem
n o t o n l y unreal b u t irrelevant, and n o t o n l y irrelevant b u t anemic.
I t is the total involvement i n all-inclusive nowness that occurs i n
y o u n g lives via T V ' s mosaic image. T h i s change of attitude has
n o t h i n g t o do w i t h p r o g r a m m i n g i n any w a y , and w o u l d be the
same i f the programs consisted entirely of the highest cultural
content. T h e change i n attitude b y means o f relating themselves
t o the mosaic T V image w o u l d occur i n any event. I t is, of course,
our job n o t o n l y to understand this change b u t t o exploit i t f o r its
pedagogical richness. T h e T V child expects involvement and
doesn't w a n t a specialist job i n the f u t u r e . H e does w a n t a role
and a deep commitment t o his society. U n b r i d l e d and misunderstood, this r i c h l y human need can manifest itself i n the distorted
forms portrayed i n West Side
Story.
T h e T V child cannot see ahead because he wants involvement,
and he cannot accept a fragmentary and merely visualized goal o r
destiny i n learning or i n life.
MURDER

BY

TELEVISION

Jack R u b y shot Lee Oswald w h i l e t i g h t l y surrounded b y
guards w h o were paralyzed b y television cameras. T h e fascinating
and i n v o l v i n g power o f television scarcely needed this additional
p r o o f o f its peculiar operation u p o n human perceptions. T h e
Kennedy assassination gave people an immediate sense of the
television power t o create depth involvement, o n the one hand,
and a n u m b i n g effect as deep as grief, itself, o n the other hand.
Most people were amazed at the depth o f meaning w h i c h the

event communicated to them. M a n y more were surprised b y the
coolness and calm o f the mass reaction. T h e same event, handled
b y press or radio ( i n the absence o f television), w o u l d have p r o vided a t o t a l l y different experience. T h e national " l i d " w o u l d have
" b l o w n o f f . " Excitement w o u l d have been enormously greater and
depth participation i n a common awareness v e r y m u c h less.
As explained earlier, Kennedy was an excellent T V image.
H e had used the m e d i u m w i t h the same effectiveness that Roosevelt
had learned t o achieve b y radio. W i t h T V , Kennedy f o u n d i t
natural t o involve the nation i n the office o f the Presidency, b o t h
as an operation and as an image. T V reaches out f o r the corporate
attributes o f office. Potentially, i t can transform the Presidency
i n t o a monarchic dynasty. A merely elective Presidency scarcely
affords the depth o f dedication and commitment demanded b y the
T V f o r m . Even teachers on T V seem t o be endowed b y the
student audiences w i t h a charismatic or mystic character that
m u c h exceeds the feelings developed i n the classroom or lecture hall. I n the course o f m a n y studies of audience reactions
to T V teaching, there recurs this puzzling fact. T h e viewers
feel that the teacher has a dimension almost o f sacredness.
T h i s feeling does n o t have its basis i n concepts or ideas, b u t seems
to creep i n uninvited and unexplained. I t baffles b o t h the students
and the analysts o f their reactions. Surely, there c o u l d be no more
telling t o u c h t o t i p us off t o the character o f T V . T h i s is not so
m u c h a visual as a tactual-auditory m e d i u m that involves all of our
senses i n depth interplay. For people l o n g accustomed t o the
merely visual experience o f the typographic and photographic
varieties, i t w o u l d seem t o be the synesthesia, or tactual depth of
T V experience, that dislocates t h e m f r o m their usual attitudes of
passivity and detachment.
T h e banal and ritual remark o f the conventionally literate,
that T V presents an experience f o r passive viewers, is w i d e of the
mark. T V is above all a m e d i u m that demands a creatively participant response. T h e guards w h o failed t o protect Lee Oswald
were not passive. T h e y were so involved b y the mere sight o f the
T V cameras that they lost their sense of their merely practical
and specialist task.

Television/'337
Perhaps i t was the K e n n e d y funeral that most strongly i m pressed the audience w i t h the power o f T V t o invest an occasion
w i t h the character o f corporate participation. N o national event
except i n sports has ever had such coverage or such an audience.
I t revealed the unrivaled p o w e r o f T V t o achieve the involvement
o f the audience i n a complex process. T h e funeral as a corporate
process caused even the image o f sport t o pale and dwindle i n t o
p u n y proportions. T h e K e n n e d y funeral, i n short, manifested the
p o w e r o f T V t o involve an entire population i n a ritual process.
B y comparison, press, movie and even radio are mere packaging
devices f o r consumers.
M o s t o f all, the K e n n e d y event provides an o p p o r t u n i t y f o r
n o t i n g a paradoxical feature o f the " c o o l " T V medium. I t involves
us i n m o v i n g depth, b u t i t does n o t excite, agitate or arouse.
Presumably, this is a feature of all depth experience.

the w a r o f the icons, or the eroding o f the collective countenance
o f one's rivals, has l o n g been under w a y . I n k and photo are supplanting soldiery and tanks. T h e pen daily becomes mightier than
the s w o r d .
T h e French phrase "guerre des nerfs" o f t w e n t y - f i v e years
ago has since come t o be referred t o as "the c o l d w a r . " I t is really
an electric battle o f i n f o r m a t i o n and of images that goes far deeper
and is more obsessional than the o l d hot wars of industrial hardware.
T h e " h o t " wars o f the past used weapons that knocked off
the enemy, one b y one. Even ideological warfare i n the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries proceeded b y persuading individuals t o
adopt new points o f v i e w , one at a time. Electric persuasion b y

t o "corporate posture."
Parallel to the n e w c o l d w a r of i n f o r m a t i o n exchange is the
situation commented o n b y James Reston i n a Neiv York
Times
release f r o m W a s h i n g t o n :
Politics has gone international. The British Labor Leader is
here campaigning for Prime Minister of Britain, and fairly
soon John F. Kennedy w i l l be over i n Italy and Germany
campaigning for reelection. Everybody's now whistle-stopping through somebody else's country, usually ours.
Washington has still not adjusted to this third-man role.
I t keeps forgetting that anything said here may be used by
one side or another i n some election campaign, and that i t
may, by accident, be the decisive element i n the final vote.
I f the cold w a r i n 1964 is being f o u g h t b y informational techn o l o g y , that is because all wars have been f o u g h t b y the latest
technology available i n any culture. I n one o f his sermons J o h n
Donne commented t h a n k f u l l y o n the blessing o f heavy firearms:

340/Understanding

So by the benefit of this light of reason they have found
out Artillery, by which warres come to quicker ends than
heretofore . . .
T h e scientific knowledge needed f o r the use of g u n p o w d e r
and the b o r i n g o f cannon appeared t o Donne as " t h e l i g h t o f
reason." H e failed t o notice another advance i n the same techn o l o g y that hastened and extended the scope of human slaughter.
I t is referred t o b y John U . N e f i n War and Human
Progress:
The gradual abandonment of armor as a part of the equipment of soldiers during the seventeenth century freed some
metal supplies for the manufacture of firearms and missiles.
I t is easy t o discover i n this a seamless w e b o f i n t e r w o v e n events
w h e n w e t u r n t o l o o k at the psychic and social consequences
o f the technological extensions o f man.
Back i n the 1920s K i n g Amanullah seems t o have p u t his
finger on this w e b w h e n he said, after f i r i n g off a torpedo:
" I feel half an Englishman already."
T h e same sense o f the relentlessly i n t e r w o v e n texture of
human fate was touched b y the schoolboy w h o said:
" D a d , I hate w a r . "
" W h y , son?"
"Because w a r makes history, and I hate h i s t o r y . "
T h e techniques developed over the centuries f o r d r i l l i n g g u n barrels provided the means that made possible the steam engine.
T h e piston shaft and the g u n presented the same problems i n

the o l d muskets, creating the K e n t u c k y rifle. I t was the h i g h l y
literate Bostonians w h o outshot the British regulars. Marksmanship is n o t the g i f t o f the native or the woodsman, b u t of the
literate colonist. So runs this argument that links gunfire itself
w i t h the rise o f perspective, and w i t h the extension o f the visual
p o w e r i n literacy. I n the Marine Corps i t has been f o u n d that
there is a definite correlation between education and marksmanship. N o t f o r the nonliterate is our easy selection o f a separate,
isolated target i n space, w i t h the rifle as an extension o f the eye.
I f gunpowder was k n o w n l o n g before i t was used f o r guns,
the same is also true o f the use of the lodestone or magnet. Its use
i n the compass f o r lineal navigation had, also, t o w a i t f o r the discovery o f lineal perspective i n the arts. Navigators t o o k a l o n g time
t o accept the possibility o f space as u n i f o r m , connected, and c o n tinuous. T o d a y i n physics, as i n painting and sculpture, progress
consists i n giving u p the idea o f space as either u n i f o r m , c o n tinuous, or connected. V i s u a l i t y has lost its p r i m a c y .
I n the Second W o r l d W a r the marksman was replaced b y
automatic weapons fired b l i n d l y i n w h a t were called "perimeters
o f fire" or " f i r e lanes." T h e old-timers f o u g h t to retain the b o l t action Springfield w h i c h encouraged single-shot accuracy and
sighting. Spraying the air w i t h lead i n a k i n d o f tactual embrace
was f o u n d t o be good b y night, as w e l l as b y day, and sighting was
unnecessary. A t this stage o f technology, the literate man is somew h a t i n the position o f the old-timers w h o backed the Springfield rifle against perimeter fire. I t is this same visual habit that
deters and obstructs literate man i n m o d e r n physics, as M i l i c
Capek explains i n The Philosophical Impact of Modern
Physics.

t o conceive the nonvisual velocities and relations of the subatomic
world.
O u r h i g h l y literate societies are at a loss as t h e y encounter
the n e w structures o f opinion and feeling that result f r o m instant
and global i n f o r m a t i o n . T h e y are still i n the g r i p o f "points of
v i e w " and of habits o f dealing w i t h things one at a time. Such
habits are quite c r i p p l i n g i n any electric structure of i n f o r m a t i o n
movement, y e t t h e y could be controlled i f w e recognized whence
they had been acquired. B u t literate society thinks o f its artificial
visual bias as a t h i n g natural and innate.
L i t e r a c y remains even n o w the base and model o f all programs
o f industrial mechanization; b u t , at the same time, i t locks the
minds and senses o f its users i n the mechanical and fragmentary
matrix that is so necessary t o the maintenance o f mechanized
society. T h a t is w h y the transition f r o m mechanical t o electric
technology is so v e r y traumatic and severe f o r us all. T h e mechanical techniques, w i t h their l i m i t e d powers, w e have l o n g used
as weapons. T h e electric techniques cannot be used aggressively
except to end all life at once, like the t u r n i n g off o f a l i g h t . T o live
w i t h b o t h o f these technologies at the same time is the peculiar
drama o f the t w e n t i e t h century.
I n his Education Automation, R. Buckminster Fuller considers
that weaponry has been a source o f technological advance f o r
mankind because i t requires continually i m p r o v e d performance
w i t h ever smaller means. " A s w e w e n t f r o m the ships o f the sea
to the ships of the air, the performance per p o u n d o f the equipment and fuel became o f even higher importance than o n the sea."
I t is this t r e n d t o w a r d more and m o r e power w i t h less and less
hardware that is characteristic o f the electric age of i n f o r m a t i o n .
Fuller has estimated that i n the first half c e n t u r y of the airplane
the nations of the w o r l d have invested t w o and a half t r i l l i o n
dollars b y subsidy o f the airplane as a weapon. H e added that
this amounts t o s i x t y - t w o times the value o f all the g o l d i n the
w o r l d . H i s approach t o these problems is more technological than
the approach of historians, w h o have o f t e n tended t o find that w a r
produces n o t h i n g n e w i n the w a y o f invention.
" T h i s man w i l l teach us h o w t o beat h i m , " Peter the Great

Weapons/343
is said t o have remarked after his a r m y had been beaten b y
Charles X I I of Sweden. T o d a y , the b a c k w a r d countries can learn
f r o m us h o w t o beat us. I n the new electric age of i n f o r m a t i o n ,
the backward countries enjoy some specific advantages over the
h i g h l y literate and industrialized cultures. F o r b a c k w a r d countries
have the habit and understanding of oral propaganda and persuasion that was eroded i n industrial societies l o n g ago. T h e Russians
had o n l y t o adapt their traditions of Eastern i c o n and imageb u i l d i n g t o the n e w electric media i n order t o be aggressively
effective i n the m o d e r n w o r l d o f i n f o r m a t i o n . T h e idea o f the
Image, that Madison Avenue has had to learn the hard w a y , was
the o n l y idea available t o Russian propaganda. T h e Russians have
n o t shown imagination o r resourcefulness i n their propaganda.
T h e y have merely done that w h i c h their religious and cultural
traditions taught t h e m ; namely, t o b u i l d images.
T h e c i t y , itself, is traditionally a m i l i t a r y weapon, and is a
collective shield or plate armor, an extension o f the castle of our
v e r y skins. Before the huddle o f the c i t y , there was the f o o d gathering phase o f man the hunter, even as men have n o w i n the
electric age returned psychically and socially t o the nomad state.
N o w , however, i t is called information-gathering and data-processing. B u t i t is global, and i t ignores and replaces the f o r m o f the
c i t y w h i c h has, therefore, tended t o become obsolete. W i t h instant
electric technology, the globe itself can never again be more than
a village, and the v e r y nature of c i t y as a f o r m o f major dimensions
must inevitably dissolve like a fading shot i n a movie. T h e first
circumnavigation of the globe i n the Renaissance gave men a
sense o f embracing and possessing the earth that was quite new,
even as the recent astronauts have again altered man's relation t o
the planet, reducing its scope t o the extent o f an evening's stroll.
T h e c i t y , like a ship, is a collective extension o f the castle o f
our skins, even as c l o t h i n g is an extension o f our individual skins.
B u t weapons proper are extensions o f hands, nails, and teeth, and
come i n t o existence as tools needed f o r accelerating the processing
o f matter. T o d a y , w h e n w e live i n a t i m e o f sudden transition
f r o m mechanical to electric technology, i t is easier t o see the
character o f all previous technologies, w e being detached f r o m all

344/'Understanding

o f them f o r the time being. Since our new electric technology
is n o t an extension o f our bodies b u t of our central nervous systems,
w e n o w see all technology, including language, as a means of
processing experience, a means o f storing and speeding i n f o r m a t i o n . A n d i n such a situation all technology can plausibly be
regarded as weapons. Previous wars can n o w be regarded as the
processing o f difficult and resistant materials b y the latest technology, the speedy dumping o f industrial products o n an enemy
market to the p o i n t of social saturation. W a r , i n fact, can be seen
as a process o f achieving equilibrium among unequal technologies,
a fact that explains Toynbee's puzzled observation that each invent i o n o f a new weapon is a disaster f o r society, and that militarism
itself is the most c o m m o n cause o f the breaking o f civilizations.
B y militarism, Rome extended civilization or individualism,
literacy, and lineality t o many oral and b a c k w a r d tribes. Even t o day the mere existence o f a literate and industrial W e s t appears
quite naturally as dire aggression t o nonliterate societies; just as the
mere existence o f the atom b o m b appears as a state o f universal
aggression t o industrial and mechanized societies.
O n the one hand, a new weapon or technology looms as a
threat t o all w h o lack i t . O n the other hand, w h e n e v e r y b o d y has
the same technological aids, there begins the competitive f u r y of
the homogenized and the egalitarian pattern against w h i c h the
strategy o f social class and caste has o f t e n been used i n the past.
F o r caste and class are techniques o f social s l o w - d o w n that tend t o
create the stasis o f tribal societies. T o d a y w e appear t o be poised
between t w o ages—one of detribalization and one o f retribalization.
Between the acting of a dreadful thing,
A n d the first motion, all the interim is
Like a Phantasma, or a hideous Dream:
The genius and the mortal instruments
Are then in council; and the state of man,
Like to a little Kingdom, suffers then
The nature of an insurrection.
(Julius Caesar, Brutus I I , i )
I f mechanical technology as extension of parts o f the human
b o d y had exerted a fragmenting force, psychically and socially,

Weapons/345
this fact appears nowhere more v i v i d l y than i n mechanical weapo n r y . W i t h the extension o f the central nervous system b y electric
technology, even w e a p o n r y makes more v i v i d the fact of the u n i t y
o f the human f a m i l y . T h e v e r y inclusiveness o f i n f o r m a t i o n as
a weapon becomes a daily reminder that politics and history must
be recast i n the f o r m o f "the concretization o f human f r a t e r n i t y . "
T h i s dilemma o f w e a p o n r y appears v e r y clearly t o Leslie
D e w a r t i n his Christianity

obsolescence o f the fragmented balance-of-power techniques. A s

i n the automation age. T h i s is a familiar
pattern i n electric technology i n general.
I t ends the o l d dichotomies between c u l -

Automation/'347
ture and technology, between art and commerce, and between
w o r k and leisure. Whereas i n the mechanical age o f fragmentation
leisure had been the absence o f w o r k , or mere idleness, the reverse
is t r u e i n the electric age. A s the age of i n f o r m a t i o n demands the
simultaneous use o f all our faculties, w e discover that w e are most
at leisure w h e n w e are most intensely involved, v e r y m u c h as w i t h
the artists i n all ages.
I n terms of the industrial age, i t can be pointed out that the
difference between the previous mechanical age and the n e w
electric age appears i n the different kinds of inventories. Since
electricity, inventories are made u p n o t so m u c h of goods i n
storage as o f materials i n continuous process o f transformation at
spatially removed sites. F o r electricity n o t o n l y gives p r i m a c y t o
process, whether i n m a k i n g or i n learning, b u t i t makes independent the source of energy f r o m the location o f the process. I n
entertainment media, w e speak of this fact as "mass media"
because the source o f the p r o g r a m and the process of experiencing
i t are independent i n space, y e t simultaneous i n time. I n i n d u s t r y
this basic fact causes the scientific r e v o l u t i o n that is called "autom a t i o n " or " c y b e r n a t i o n . "
I n education the conventional division o f the c u r r i c u l u m i n t o
subjects is already as outdated as the medieval t r i v i u m and quadr i v i u m after the Renaissance. A n y subject taken i n depth at once
relates t o other subjects. A r i t h m e t i c i n grade three or nine, w h e n
taught i n terms o f number t h e o r y , symbolic logic, and cultural
history, ceases to be mere practice i n problems. Continued i n their
present patterns of fragmented unrelation, our school curricula
w i l l insure a citizenry unable t o understand the cybernated w o r l d
i n w h i c h they live.
M o s t scientists are quite aware that since w e have acquired
some knowledge of electricity i t is not possible t o speak o f atoms
as pieces o f matter. A g a i n , as more is k n o w n about electrical
"discharges" and energy, there is less and less tendency t o speak
o f electricity as a t h i n g that " f l o w s " like water t h r o u g h a w i r e ,
or is "contained" i n a battery. Rather, the tendency is t o speak o f
electricity as painters speak of space; namely, that i t is a variable
condition that involves the special positions o f t w o or more bodies.

348/Understanding

Media

T h e r e is no longer any tendency t o speak o f electricity as " c o n tained" i n anything. Painters have l o n g k n o w n that objects are n o t
contained i n space, b u t that t h e y generate their o w n spaces. I t was
the dawning awareness o f this i n the mathematical w o r l d a c e n t u r y
ago that enabled Lewis Carroll, the O x f o r d mathematician, t o
contrive Alice in Wonderland,
i n w h i c h times and spaces are
neither u n i f o r m n o r continuous, as t h e y had seemed t o be since
the arrival o f Renaissance perspective. As f o r the speed o f light,
that is merely the speed of total causality.
I t is a principal aspect of the electric age that i t establishes
a global n e t w o r k that has m u c h o f the character o f our central
nervous system. O u r central nervous system is n o t merely an
electric n e t w o r k , b u t i t constitutes a single unified field of experience. As biologists point out, the brain is the interacting place
where all kinds o f impressions and experiences can be exchanged
and translated, enabling us t o react to the world as a whole.
N a t u r a l l y , w h e n electric technology comes into play, the utmost
variety and extent o f operations i n i n d u s t r y and society q u i c k l y
assume a unified posture. Y e t this organic u n i t y o f interprocess
that electromagnetism inspires i n the most diverse and specialized
areas and organs o f action is quite the opposite o f organization i n
a mechanized society. Mechanization o f any process is achieved
b y fragmentation, beginning w i t h the mechanization o f w r i t i n g
b y movable types, w h i c h has been called the "monofracture of
manufacture."
T h e electric telegraph, w h e n crossed w i t h t y p o g r a p h y ,
created the strange new f o r m o f the m o d e r n newspaper. A n y
page of the telegraph press is a surrealistic mosaic of bits o f
"human interest" i n v i v i d interaction. Such was the art f o r m of
Chaplin and the early silent movies. H e r e , too, an extreme speedu p o f mechanization, an assembly line of still shots o n celluloid,
led t o a strange reversal. T h e movie mechanism, aided b y the elect r i c light, created the illusion o f organic f o r m and movement as
m u c h as a fixed position had created the illusion o f perspective
on a flat surface five hundred years before.
T h e same t h i n g happens less superficially w h e n the electric
principle crosses the mechanical lines of industrial organization.

Automation/'349
A u t o m a t i o n retains o n l y as m u c h of the mechanical character as
the motorcar kept o f the forms o f the horse and the carriage.
Y e t people discuss automation as i f w e had n o t passed the oat
barrier, and as i f the horse-vote at the next p o l l w o u l d sweep away
the automation regime.
A u t o m a t i o n is n o t an extension o f the mechanical principles
o f fragmentation and separation of operations. I t is rather the
invasion o f the mechanical w o r l d b y the instantaneous character
o f electricity. T h a t is w h y those involved i n automation insist
that i t is a w a y o f t h i n k i n g , as m u c h as i t is a w a y of doing.
Instant synchronization o f numerous operations has ended the o l d
mechanical pattern o f setting u p operations i n lineal sequence.
T h e assembly line has gone the w a y of the stag line. N o r is i t just
the lineal and sequential aspect o f mechanical analysis that has
been erased b y the electric speed-up and exact synchronizing of
i n f o r m a t i o n that is automation.
A u t o m a t i o n or cybernation deals w i t h all the units and c o m ponents o f the industrial and marketing process exactly as radio or
T V combine the individuals i n the audience i n t o n e w interprocess.
T h e n e w k i n d of interrelation i n b o t h industry and entertainment
is the result of the electric instant speed. O u r n e w electric techn o l o g y n o w extends the instant processing o f knowledge b y interrelation that has l o n g occurred w i t h i n our central nervous system.
I t is that same speed that constitutes "organic u n i t y " and ends the
mechanical age that had gone i n t o high gear w i t h Gutenberg.
A u t o m a t i o n brings i n real "mass p r o d u c t i o n , " n o t i n terms of size,
b u t o f an instant inclusive embrace. Such is also the character o f
"mass media." T h e y are an indication, n o t o f the size o f their
audiences, b u t of the fact that everybody becomes involved i n
them at the same time. T h u s c o m m o d i t y industries under automation share the same structural character o f the entertainment
industries i n the degree that b o t h approximate the condition of
instant i n f o r m a t i o n . A u t o m a t i o n affects n o t just p r o d u c t i o n , b u t
every phase of consumption and marketing; f o r the consumer
becomes producer i n the automation circuit, quite as m u c h as the
reader of the mosaic telegraph press makes his o w n news, or just
is his o w n news.

3 50/Understanding

Media

B u t there is a component i n the automation story that is as
basic as t a c t i l i t y t o the T V image. I t is the fact that, i n any automatic machine, or galaxy o f machines and functions, the generat i o n and transmission o f power is quite separate f r o m the w o r k
operation that uses the power. T h e same is true i n all servomechanist structures that involve feedback. T h e source o f energy
is separate f r o m the process o f translation of i n f o r m a t i o n , or the
applying o f knowledge. T h i s is obvious i n the telegraph, where the
energy and channel are quite independent of whether the w r i t t e n
code is French or German. T h e same separation of p o w e r and
process obtains i n automated industry, or i n " c y b e r n a t i o n . " T h e
electric energy can be applied i n d i f f e r e n t l y and q u i c k l y t o many
kinds o f tasks.
Such was never the case i n the mechanical systems. T h e power
and the w o r k done were always i n direct relation, whether i t
was hand and hammer, water and wheel, horse and cart, o r steam
and piston. E l e c t r i c i t y b r o u g h t a strange elasticity i n this matter,
m u c h as l i g h t itself illuminates a t o t a l field and does n o t dictate
what shall be done. T h e same l i g h t can make possible a m u l t i p l i c i t y
o f tasks, just as w i t h electric power. L i g h t is a nonspecialist k i n d
o f energy or p o w e r that is identical w i t h i n f o r m a t i o n and k n o w l edge. Such is also the relation o f electricity t o automation, since
b o t h energy and i n f o r m a t i o n can be applied i n a great variety of
ways.
Grasp o f this fact is indispensable t o the understanding of the
electronic age, and o f automation i n particular. E n e r g y and p r o duction n o w tend t o fuse w i t h i n f o r m a t i o n and learning. M a r k e t i n g and consumption tend to become one w i t h learning, enlightenment, and the intake o f i n f o r m a t i o n . T h i s is all part o f the electric
implosion that n o w follows or succeeds the centuries o f explosion
and increasing specialism. T h e electronic age is literally one o f
illumination. Just as l i g h t is at once energy and i n f o r m a t i o n , so
electric automation unites p r o d u c t i o n , consumption, and learning
i n an inextricable process. F o r this reason, teachers are already the
largest employee group i n the U.S. economy, and m a y w e l l

T h e v e r y same process o f automation that causes a w i t h -

Automation/351
drawal of the present w o r k force f r o m i n d u s t r y causes learning
itself t o become the principal k i n d o f p r o d u c t i o n and consumpt i o n . Hence the f o l l y o f alarm about unemployment. Paid learning
is already becoming b o t h the dominant employment and the source
o f n e w wealth i n our society. T h i s is the n e w role f o r men i n
society, whereas the older mechanistic idea o f "jobs," or f r a g mented tasks and specialist slots f o r " w o r k e r s , " becomes meaningless under automation.
I t has often been said b y engineers that, as i n f o r m a t i o n levels
rise, almost any sort o f material can be adapted t o any sort of use.
T h i s principle is the k e y t o the understanding o f electric automat i o n . I n the case o f electricity, as energy f o r p r o d u c t i o n becomes
independent of the w o r k operation, there is n o t o n l y the speed
that makes f o r total and organic interplay, b u t there is, also, the
fact that electricity is sheer i n f o r m a t i o n that, i n actual practice,
illuminates all i t touches. A n y process that approaches instant
interrelation of a total field tends t o raise itself t o the level o f
conscious awareness, so that computers seem t o " t h i n k . " I n fact,
t h e y are h i g h l y specialized at present, and quite lacking i n the
f u l l process of interrelation that makes f o r consciousness. O b v i ously, they can be made t o simulate the process o f consciousness,
just as our electric global networks n o w begin t o simulate the
c o n d i t i o n of our central nervous system. B u t a conscious computer
w o u l d still be one that was an extension o f our consciousness, as a
telescope is an extension o f our eyes, or as a ventriloquist's d u m m y
is an extension o f the ventriloquist.
A u t o m a t i o n certainly assumes the servomechanism and the
computer. T h a t is t o say, i t assumes electricity as store and expediter o f i n f o r m a t i o n . These traits of store, or " m e m o r y , " and
accelerator are the basic features o f any m e d i u m o f communication
whatever. I n the case o f electricity, i t is n o t corporeal substance
that is stored or moved, b u t perception and i n f o r m a t i o n . A s f o r
technological acceleration, i t n o w approaches the speed o f light.
A l l nonelectric media had merely hastened things a b i t . T h e wheel,
the road, the ship, the airplane, and even the space rocket are
u t t e r l y lacking i n the character of instant movement. Is i t strange,
then, that electricity should confer o n all previous human or-

and the Schmoo ecstatically transformed itself i n t o the object o f
desire. A u t o m a t i o n brings us i n t o the w o r l d o f the Schmoo. T h e
custom-built supplants the mass-produced.
L e t us, as the Chinese say, move our chairs closer t o the

w i t h automation have n o t h i n g t o do w i t h ideologies or social
programs. I f t h e y had, t h e y could be delayed or controlled. I n stead, the technological extension o f our central nervous system
that w e call the electric media began more than a century ago,
subliminally. Subliminal have been the effects. Subliminal they
remain. A t no period i n human culture have men understood the
psychic mechanisms involved i n invention and technology. T o d a y
i t is the instant speed o f electric i n f o r m a t i o n that, f o r the first
time, permits easy recognition o f the patterns and the f o r m a l
contours o f change and development. T h e entire w o r l d , past and
present, n o w reveals itself t o us like a g r o w i n g plant i n an enormously accelerated movie. Electric speed is synonymous w i t h l i g h t
and w i t h the understanding o f causes. So, w i t h the use o f elect r i c i t y i n previously mechanized situations, men easily discover
causal connections and patterns that were quite unobservable
at the slower rates of mechanical change. I f w e play backward
the l o n g development o f literacy and p r i n t i n g and their effects o n
social experience and organization, w e can easily see h o w these
forms brought about that h i g h degree o f social u n i f o r m i t y and

once more because its speed of operation requires a high degree of
interdependence among all phases o f any operation. I t is this elect r i c speed-up and interdependence that has ended the assembly
line i n industry.
T h i s same need f o r organic interrelation, b r o u g h t i n b y the
electric speed o f synchronization, n o w requires us t o p e r f o r m ,
i n d u s t r y - b y - i n d u s t r y , and c o u n t r y - b y - c o u n t r y , exactly the same
organic interrelating that was first effected i n the individual
automated unit. Electric speed requires organic structuring of
the global economy quite as m u c h as early mechanization b y p r i n t
and b y road led to the acceptance o f national u n i t y . L e t us n o t
f o r g e t that nationalism was a m i g h t y invention and revolution that,
i n the Renaissance, w i p e d o u t many o f the local regions and l o y a l ties. I t was a r e v o l u t i o n achieved almost entirely b y the speed-up

c u t across most o f the traditional p o w e r and cultural groupings
that had s l o w l y g r o w n u p i n various regions. Mutli-nationalisms
had l o n g deprived Europe of its economic u n i t y . T h e C o m m o n
M a r k e t came t o i t o n l y w i t h the Second W a r . W a r is accelerated
social change, as an explosion is an accelerated chemical reaction
and movement o f matter. W i t h electric speeds governing indust r y and social life, explosion i n the sense o f crash development
becomes normal. O n the other hand, the old-fashioned k i n d o f
" w a r " becomes as impracticable as p l a y i n g hopscotch w i t h b u l l dozers. Organic interdependence means that disruption o f any part
o f the organism can prove fatal to the w h o l e . E v e r y i n d u s t r y has
had t o " r e t h i n k t h r o u g h " (the awkwardness o f this phrase betrays
the painfulness o f the process), f u n c t i o n b y f u n c t i o n , its place
i n the economy. B u t automation forces n o t o n l y i n d u s t r y and

trained and homogenized citizenry, so l o n g i n preparation and
so necessary to a mechanized society, is becoming quite a burden
and problem t o an automated society, f o r automation and elect r i c i t y require depth approaches i n all fields and at all times.
Hence the sudden rejection o f standardized goods and scenery
and l i v i n g and education i n A m e r i c a since the Second W a r . I t
is a s w i t c h imposed b y electric technology i n general, and b y the
T V image i n particular.
A u t o m a t i o n was first f e l t and seen o n a large scale i n the
chemical industries o f gas, coal, o i l , and metallic ores. T h e large
changes i n these operations made possible b y electric energy
have n o w , b y means of the computer, begun t o invade every
k i n d o f white-collar and management area. M a n y people, i n c o n sequence, have begun t o l o o k o n the w h o l e of society as a single
unified machine f o r creating wealth. Such has been the normal
outlook of the stockbroker, manipulating shares and i n f o r m a t i o n
w i t h the cooperation o f the electric media of press, radio, telephone, and teletype. B u t the peculiar and abstract manipulation
o f i n f o r m a t i o n as a means o f creating wealth is no longer a
m o n o p o l y o f the stockbroker. I t is n o w shared b y every engineer
and b y the entire communications industries. W i t h electricity
as energizer and synchronizer, all aspects of p r o d u c t i o n , consumption, and organization become incidental t o communications.
T h e v e r y idea o f communication as interplay is inherent i n the
electrical, w h i c h combines b o t h energy and i n f o r m a t i o n i n its
intensive m a n i f o l d .
A n y b o d y w h o begins to examine the patterns o f automation
finds that perfecting the individual machine b y m a k i n g i t automatic involves "feedback." T h a t means i n t r o d u c i n g an i n f o r m a t i o n
loop or circuit, where before there had been merely a one-way
flow or mechanical sequence. Feedback is the end o f the lineality
that came i n t o the W e s t e r n w o r l d w i t h the alphabet and the
continuous forms o f Euclidean space. Feedback or dialogue between the mechanism and its environment brings a f u r t h e r weavi n g o f individual machines i n t o a galaxy o f such machines t h r o u g h out the entire plant. T h e r e f o l l o w s a still f u r t h e r weaving o f
individual plants and factories i n t o the entire industrial matrix of

materials and services o f a culture. N a t u r a l l y , this last stage encounters the entire w o r l d of policy, since t o deal w i t h the w h o l e
industrial complex as an organic system affects employment,
security, education, and politics, demanding f u l l understanding
i n advance of c o m i n g structural change. T h e r e is no r o o m f o r
witless assumptions and subliminal factors i n such electrical and
instant organizations.
As artists began a c e n t u r y ago t o construct their w o r k s backw a r d , starting with the effect, so n o w w i t h industry and planning.
I n general, electric speed-up requires complete knowledge of
ultimate effects. Mechanical speed-ups, however radical i n their
reshaping o f personal and social life, still w e r e allowed t o happen
sequentially. M e n could, f o r the most part, get t h r o u g h a n o r m a l
life span o n the basis o f a single set o f skills. T h a t is n o t at all
the case w i t h electric speed-up. T h e acquiring of n e w basic
knowledge and skill b y senior executives i n middle age is one of
the most c o m m o n needs and h a r r o w i n g facts of electric techn o l o g y . T h e senior executives, or " b i g wheels," as t h e y are
archaically and i r o n i c a l l y designated, are among the hardest
pressed and most persistently harassed groups i n human history.
E l e c t r i c i t y has n o t o n l y demanded ever deeper knowledge and
faster interplay, b u t has made the harmonizing of p r o d u c t i o n
schedules as rigorous as that demanded o f the members o f a large
s y m p h o n y orchestra. A n d the satisfactions are just as f e w f o r the
b i g executives as f o r the symphonists, since a player i n a b i g
orchestra can hear n o t h i n g o f the music that reaches the audience.
H e gets o n l y noise.
T h e result o f electric speed-up i n i n d u s t r y at large is the creation o f intense sensitivity t o the interrelation and interprocess
o f the w h o l e , so as t o call f o r ever-new types of organization
and talent. V i e w e d f r o m the o l d perspectives of the machine age,
this electric n e t w o r k x>f plants and processes seems brittle and
t i g h t . I n fact, i t is n o t mechanical, and i t does begin to develop
the sensitivity and pliability of the human organism. B u t i t also
demands the same varied nutriment and nursing as the animal
organism.
W i t h the instant and complex interprocesses of the organic

f o r m , automated i n d u s t r y also acquires the power of adaptability
t o multiple uses. A machine set u p f o r the automatic p r o d u c t i o n
o f electric bulbs represents a combination o f processes that were
previously managed b y several machines. W i t h a single attendant,
i t can r u n as continuously as a tree i n its intake and output. But,
unlike the tree, i t has a b u i l t - i n system o f jigs and fixtures that
can be shifted t o cause the machine t o t u r n o u t a w h o l e range of
products f r o m radio tubes and glass tumblers t o Christmas-tree
ornaments. A l t h o u g h an automated plant is almost like a tree i n
respect to the continuous intake and output, i t is a tree that can
change f r o m oak t o maple to w a l n u t as required. I t is part of the
automation or electric logic that specialism is no longer limited
t o just one specialty. T h e automatic machine m a y w o r k i n a
specialist w a y , b u t i t is n o t limited t o one line. As w i t h our hands
and fingers that are capable o f many tasks, the automatic u n i t
incorporates a p o w e r o f adaptation that was quite lacking i n the
pre-electric and mechanical stage o f technology. A s anything
becomes more complex, i t becomes less specialized. M a n is more
complex and less specialized than a dinosaur. T h e older mechanical
operations were designed t o be m o r e efficient as t h e y became
larger and more specialized. T h e electric and automated unit,
however, is quite otherwise. A n e w automatic machine f o r making
automobile tailpipes is about the size o f t w o or three office desks.
T h e computer c o n t r o l panel is the size o f a lectern. I t has i n i t no
dies, no fixtures, no settings o f any k i n d , b u t rather certain general-purpose things like grippers, benders, and advancers. O n this
machine, starting w i t h lengths o f o r d i n a r y pipe, i t is possible t o
make eighty different kinds of tailpipe i n succession, as r a p i d l y ,
as easily, and as cheaply as i t is t o make eighty o f the same k i n d .
A n d the characteristic o f electric automation is all i n this direct i o n o f r e t u r n t o the general-purpose handicraft flexibility that
our o w n hands possess. T h e p r o g r a m m i n g can n o w include endless changes o f program. I t is the electric feedback, or dialogue
pattern, o f the automatic and computer-programmed "machine"
that marks i t off f r o m the older mechanical principle o f one-way
movement.
T h i s computer offers a model that has the characteristics

Automation/'3

shared b y all automation. F r o m the p o i n t o f intake o f materials
t o the output o f the finished p r o d u c t , the operations tend t o be
independently, as w e l l as interdependently, automatic. T h e s y n chronized concert o f operations is under the c o n t r o l o f gauges
and instruments that can be varied f r o m the control-panel boards
that are themselves electronic. T h e material o f intake is relatively
u n i f o r m i n shape, size, and chemical properties, as likewise the
material of the output. B u t the processing under these conditions
permits use of the highest level o f capacity f o r any needed period.
I t is, as compared w i t h the older machines, the difference between
an oboe i n an orchestra and the same tone o n an electronic music
instrument. W i t h the electronic music instrument, any tone can
be made available i n any intensity and f o r any length o f time.
N o t e that the older s y m p h o n y orchestra was, b y comparison, a
machine o f separate instruments that gave the effect of organic
unity. W i t h the electronic instrument, one starts w i t h organic
u n i t y as an immediate fact o f perfect synchronization. T h i s makes
the attempt t o create the effect of organic u n i t y quite pointless.
Electronic music must seek other goals.
Such is also the harsh logic o f industrial automation. A l l that
w e had previously achieved mechanically b y great exertion and
coordination can n o w be done electrically w i t h o u t effort. Hence
the specter of joblessness and propertylessness i n the electric age.
W e a l t h and w o r k become i n f o r m a t i o n factors, and t o t a l l y n e w
structures are needed t o r u n a business or relate i t t o social needs
and markets. W i t h the electric technology, the n e w kinds of i n stant interdependence and interprocess that take over p r o d u c t i o n
also enter the market and social organizations. F o r this reason,
markets and education designed to cope w i t h the products o f
servile t o i l and mechanical p r o d u c t i o n are no longer adequate.
O u r education has l o n g ago acquired the fragmentary and piecemeal character o f mechanism. I t is n o w under increasing pressure
t o acquire the depth and interrelation that are indispensable i n the
all-at-once w o r l d of electric organization.
Paradoxically, automation makes liberal education mandatory.
T h e electric age of servomechanisms suddenly releases m e n f r o m
the mechanical and specialist servitude o f the preceding machine

age. A s the machine and the motorcar released the horse and
projected i t onto the plane o f entertainment, so does automation
w i t h men. W e are suddenly threatened w i t h a liberation that taxes
our inner resources o f self-employment and imaginative participat i o n i n society. T h i s w o u l d seem t o be a fate that calls men
to the role o f artist i n society. I t has the effect o f m a k i n g most
people realize h o w m u c h they had come t o depend o n the f r a g mentalized and repetitive routines o f the mechanical era. T h o u sands of years ago man, the nomadic food-gatherer, had taken
up positional, or relatively sedentary, tasks. H e began t o specialize. T h e development o f w r i t i n g and p r i n t i n g were major stages
o f that process. T h e y were supremely specialist i n separating
the roles o f knowledge f r o m the roles of action, even t h o u g h
at times i t could appear that "the pen is mightier than the s w o r d . "
B u t w i t h electricity and automation, the technology o f f r a g mented processes suddenly fused w i t h the human dialogue and
the need f o r over-all consideration o f human u n i t y . M e n are
suddenly nomadic gatherers o f knowledge, nomadic as never
before, i n f o r m e d as never before, free f r o m fragmentary specialism as never before—but also i n v o l v e d i n the total social process
as never before; since w i t h electricity w e extend our central
nervous system globally, instantly interrelating every human
experience. L o n g accustomed t o such a state i n stock-market
news or front-page sensations, w e can grasp the meaning of this
new dimension more readily w h e n i t is pointed out that i t is possible to " f l y " u n b u i l t airplanes o n computers. T h e specifications
o f a plane can be programmed and the plane tested under a variety
o f extreme conditions before i t has l e f t the d r a f t i n g board. So
w i t h new products and new organizations o f many kinds. W e
can n o w , b y computer, deal w i t h complex social needs w i t h the
same architectural certainty that w e previously attempted i n
private housing. I n d u s t r y as a w h o l e has become the u n i t o f
reckoning, and so w i t h society, politics, and education as wholes.
Electric means o f storing and m o v i n g i n f o r m a t i o n w i t h
speed and precision make the largest units quite as manageable
as small ones. T h u s the automation o f a plant or o f an entire
industry offers a small model o f the changes that must occur i n

society f r o m the same electric technology. T o t a l interdependence
is the starting fact. Nevertheless, the range o f choice i n design,
stress, and goal w i t h i n that total field o f electromagnetic interprocess is v e r y m u c h greater than i t ever c o u l d have been under
mechanization.
Since electric energy is independent o f the place or k i n d of
w o r k - o p e r a t i o n , i t creates patterns of decentralism and diversity
i n the w o r k t o be done. T h i s is a logic that appears plainly enough
i n the difference between firelight and electric light, f o r example.
Persons grouped around a fire or candle f o r w a r m t h or light are
less able to pursue independent thoughts, or even tasks, than people supplied w i t h electric light. I n the same w a y , the social and
educational patterns latent i n automation are those o f self-emp l o y m e n t and artistic autonomy. Panic about automation as a
threat o f u n i f o r m i t y o n a w o r l d scale is the projection into the
f u t u r e of mechanical standardization and specialism, w h i c h are
n o w past.
